Your Week 6 notes are due on Monday, October 13.  Make sure your group's daily notes are in the document and shared with Mark.  Also make sure that your own summary of each day's activities is recorded in your personal summary document.  

If you have missed previous weeks' notes or summaries, now is a good time to get caught up on them.  If you improve your summaries or notes for a previous week, please send Mark a note letting him know that you would like a regrade.
