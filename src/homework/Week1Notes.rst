Notetaking is a critical element of doing science -- we cannot learn from what we have observed if we don't have an accurate record of what we saw, but if everyone is just recording what we see, no one is doing anything.  So only one person each day will be assigned to take notes on what occurred -- this will be their only job, and they will be required to share those notes with everyone else on the team.  

When you are not the notetaker, you should be working to figure things out, and to help the notetaker know what to write down to capture what occurred.  After you get their copy of the notes for the day, you should write a summary of what the point of the day's activities was.

At the end of the week, you will have four days' worth of notes, which I will grade on the following Monday.
