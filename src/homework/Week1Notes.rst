One day each week you will be the notetaker -- on that day you should focus on recording what we do in class, the questions that are asked, the work you do to figure out the questions, and the answers.  Then you should share these notes with the rest of your group.

On the other days, when you are not the notetaker, you should take the notes copy provided by your group member and paste them into your own notes document.  Then you should edit them to reflect your own understanding of what happened, send comments back to your notetaker if they missed anything important, and then write a good summary of the most important items from the day.  A good summary should answer the questions: *What* did you do?  *Why* did you do it?  What can you now do that you couldn't before?  What will you change tomorrow to understand better?

Your edited copy of the notes from all four class meetings in the week is due by Sunday evening, and it will be graded the following Monday.
