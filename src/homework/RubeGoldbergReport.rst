:summary: Directions for the written report on the Rube Goldberg project

Here's the details of what needs to be in the report:

1. A written description of your device, including a clear explanation of what the ending task was and a step by step timeline of each element (written as a paragraph)

2. Your design drawings, both one large drawing showing the entire device and drawings of each individual element as you intended it to work.  You cannot get credit for an element towards the required 10 unless there is a separate drawing for it.

3. A classification of each element in the device.  Kind of energy: electrical, mechanical, chemical, thermal, light; and kind of machine: lever, pulley, gear, wheel and axle, ramp, screw, etc.  This can be a bullet list, but you should explain/justify why you believe this element qualifies.  You should also explain how you built this element, the testing you had to go through, and any difficulties you had in building, testing, and running, etc.  Again, you cannot get credit for an element unless it is listed here with the explanation and justification.

4. Narrative analysis, at least answering the debriefing questions we discussed on Friday:

   a. What went right?

   b. What went wrong? Which parts just wouldn't work?

   c. What were you missing that you needed? (materials, resources, concepts)

   d. Suppose you were given an opportunity to do this project again from scratch.  What would you do the same?  What would you do differently? (you should think of specific things like: No more dominoes, or Fire worked great, as well as more general things like: design timeline and testing method.

5. Your self-reflection on how well you contributed to the team, and your feedback to your teammates on how well they contributed to the team  -- we will discuss this aspect on Tuesday/Wednesday.

The report should be written as a group in a Google Doc.  Attach all relevant photos, drawings, videos, etc. within the document (so if your designs are on paper, take good photos of them to put in the doc).

The document should be named according to the convention:

YourBlock_Rube_YourNames

and it should be shared with Mark.  Grading will begin on Friday, May 2nd.
