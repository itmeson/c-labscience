In LabScience you will learn skills and concepts from the following categories, which will be taught through projects and exercise drawn from the list at the bottom of the page.  Though initial contact with each big idea will occur in roughly the following order, you should expect to use all of these ideas throughout the course.

I. Measurement

   * Unit systems / conversion
   * Measuring tools
   * Precision, accuracy, uncertainty
   * repeated measurements (averaging, standard deviation)
   * scale, significant figures, order of magnitude estimation

II. Experiment design

    * Identifying relevant variables
    * Graphing, data presentation
    * Hypothesis testing
    * Iterative design, improving measurements

III. Measuring and Describing Motion (kinematics)

     * Measuring speed
     * Representing motion with graphs and motion maps
     * Determining speed from graphs
     * Determining distance travelled from graphs

IV. Conceptual Physics
   
    * Describing and measuring interactions
    * Momentum conservation
    * Energy conservation
    * Simple machines
    * A particle model of gases

V. Big Data

   * Descriptive statistics
   * Reliability issues
   * Data representations
   * Making inferences with data
