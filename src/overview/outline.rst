Fall
----

 I. Measurement

    * Unit systems / conversion
    * Measuring tools
    * Precision, accuracy, uncertainty
    * length, mass, time, speed, volume, area, temperature, etc.
    * associating units with dimensions
    * repeated measurements (averaging)
    * scale, significant figures, order of magnitude estimation

 II. Experiment design

   * Graphing
   * Hypothesis testing


 III. Large data sets

   * Simple stats
   * Reliability issues

Winter
------

 I. Conceptual Physics
   
    * Describing and measuring motion
    * Momentum
    * Buoyancy
    * Energy



Spring
------

 I. Energy transfers

    * potential and kinetic energy
    * phase changes and reactions
    * simple machines

 II. Rube Goldberg

 III. Energy technologies and resources

team collaboration
graphing and mathematical analysis
need to work with larger data sets

better integration with math curriculum?

students need a much stronger foundation in creating and utilizing graphs
	one approach represent data in 4 different ways
