**COURSE TITLE:**	Lab Science


===================
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
===================

In this course students will practice the peculiar skill of "thinking like a scientist", with the goal that all students will leave the course able to think like scientists in many different contexts and situations.

But what does it mean to think like a scientist?  This is a little hard to
define.  Being a scientist is more like being a street fighter than a fencer --
any tool, any move will be employed if it accomplishes the goal of advancing
human understanding of the natural world.  A scientist figures stuff out and is
guided by a fundamental assumption, a prime directive, if you will, that it is
*always* possible to figure it out.  Not by asking a friend or reading a book
(though collaboration is encouraged and it is always wise to learn what others
have done) but by asking Nature directly.

How does one ask Nature a question? 

Understanding that question is the goal of this course.  The short answer is "do an experiment", but of course, it's more complicated than that.  The science fair version of the scientific method is not how real scientists work.

 

 







This course prepares students to study science in a laboratory environment,
including introduction to selected concepts in biology, chemistry and physics.
The content theme for fall term is matter (including concepts of density and
other physical properties, metric measurements, basic principles of chemistry,
and types and states of matter). The winter term content theme is energy
(including types of energy, combustion of hydrocarbons, respiration and
photosynthesis, laws of thermodynamics, and electricity).  Environmental
science is the theme for spring term (including topics in sustainability,
ecosystem services, energy choices and challenges for human communities).
Content is subject to change in order to accommodate student interests,
relevant topics, and opportunities that arise during the school year.
