COURSE OUTLINE (2013-2014)
============================

**COURSE TITLE:**	Lab Science


===================
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
===================

In this course we will practice the peculiar skill of "thinking (and acting)
like a scientist", with the goal that we will all leave the course better able
to act like scientists in many different contexts and situations.

But what does it mean to act like a scientist?  This is a little hard to
define.  Being a scientist is more like being a street fighter than a fencer --
any tool, any move will be employed if it accomplishes the goal of advancing
human understanding of the natural world.  A scientist figures stuff out and is
guided by a fundamental assumption, a prime directive, if you will, that **it is
always possible to figure it out**.  Not by asking a friend or reading a book
(though collaboration is encouraged and it is always wise to learn what others
have done) but by asking Nature directly.

How does one ask Nature a question? 

Understanding that question is the goal of this course.  The short answer is
"do an experiment", but of course, it's more complicated than that.  The
science fair version of the scientific method is not how real scientists work.
Your process in this class will include observing, questioning, model building,
model testing (the experiment itself), analysing, and
reporting/presenting/convincing in a repeating cycle that will get us ever
closer to truth and understanding.

We will accomplish this through study of particular phenomena and concepts,
most of which traditionally fall within courses in biology, chemistry, and
physics, starting with the simplest models as we increase our facility with the
process and gain deeper understanding.  The fall term theme is measurement, the
winter term focuses on energy, while the spring term focuses on application of
our skills to earth and the environment.

COURSE OUTCOMES:
================

The following are specific skills and concepts, the mastery of which will largely determine your grade in the course.  Progress reports will include an assessment of your current level of understanding and proficiency with skills that fall within each of the following areas:

1. reason deductively and inductively
2. create relevant questions about their observations
3. develop testable hypotheses
4. design experiments that test hypotheses
5. work safely with lab materials and equipment
6. use lab equipment to make observations and collect data
7. understand and use metric measurements
8. develop conclusions based on experimental/observed data
9. analyze data mathematically and graphically
10. communicate experiments and conclusions (in written, visual and oral forms) clearly and accurately
11. use scientific terminology correctly
12. find pertinent information from various sources, including resource books, libraries and the Internet
13. judge the reliability of information found in texts and the Internet
14. judge experiments with regard to sources of error, precision and accuracy


Your overall grade will be determined as a weighted average of the following areas:

1. Course outcomes	50%
2. Projects		20%
3. Homework		10%
4. Quizzes		10%
5. Final Exam		10%


It is very important that you think of your grade and the course outcomes as a
progress report on your current level of understanding and proficiency, and
**NOT** as a reflection of your worth as a human being.  This course requires
*effort* and *time*, and I *do not care if it takes you all term to learn
something*.  A low score or grade does not mean that you are not talented,
smart, or capable of succeeding in this class -- it **means that you still have
more work to do**.  Think of the class like training camp: you are not supposed
to be perfect on all the drills in the first week, or even the second.
