What's the deal with the notes?

1. To have a record of what happened on every day in class
2. To process into long-term memory the *big ideas*
3. To practice note-taking as a valuable skill in itself
4. To be able to notice interesting things, one must record them so they can be reflected upon 

The notetaking system is confusing, and takes some getting used to.  Some
students are annoyed that they have to rely on others to take notes for them,
and others are annoyed that they have to take notes, when others might do a
better job.  The reason I insist on everyone taking a turn is that there is no
way to get better at if you don't practice it, but the mental load of taking
notes and paying attention or thinking about figuring things out at the same
time is too much -- so it is better if one student is designated as the
note-taker each day, freeing the others to think without having to worry about
whether or not the results are being recorded.

Thus each student takes one turn taking notes each week, and in turn is provided with notes by their teammates the other days.  For this to work, you have to be able to trust that your team will do their jobs.  We will achieve that trust by sharing the notes each day, so we can see what has been recorded, and by giving feedback when the notes can be improved.

Each student must write their own summary of the most important points of the
day *every day* as homework.  This is the only way you will be able to process
what we have done to figure out what is important and to make sure it gets put
in your long-term memory so you can improve.  I got the idea from a soccer
coach_, who always asked his team at halftime, "What are we doing right?  What
are we doing wrong?  What are they doing right?  What do we need to change
right now?"  That thought process, repeated every game, turned his players into
strategists, enabling them to raise the level of their own game.  This is why I
ask you to answer the key questions in the summary:

1. What did I do today?
2. Why did I do it?
3. What does it help me do or understand that I couldn't before?
4. What do I need to do tomorrow to keep improving?

If you repeat that process, honestly, every day, you will turn yourself into a learning strategist (and scientist)

Finally, when I grade the notes, I am looking for completion of the daily record and for thoughtful reflection in the summary.
