Day 1

 0. Warmup: Practice converting units

 1. How bad is it if you get a measurement wrong?  Read the following article_ and help your notetaker summarize it in the notes.

 2. We're going to find out just how bad it can be by trying several different methods of measuring out the recommended dose for cough syrup -- 4 teaspoons.

    * using the provided measuring cup
    * using a kitchen teaspoon
    * using a kitchen spoon
    * using a graduated cylinder
    * using a balance

 3. Which way is the most reliable?  Why?

 4. How far off could your measurement be using each of the methods?

 5. Even perfectly performed measurements *always* have some uncertainty.  You measured 3 centimeters, but was it exactly 3?  Or 3.1? 3.01? 3.005?  How can you tell?
