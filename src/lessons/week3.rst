:category: lessons
:tags: rain, data, motion, speed, acceleration


===========
Day 1, 2, 3
===========

1. Rain gauge data.  Your objective is to answer at least two interesting questions about the rain data set. You will be presenting this work to the class in a short informal presentation during the double block this week.  Focus on interesting insights either about the rainfall or about what the data reveals about our habits in recording the rainfall.

Your presentation should explain what you have learned, and how you figured it out.

A Christmas puzzle:

Disclaimer: I am not taking a position on the reality of Santa Claus.

According to the standard American version of the Santa Claus story, Santa visits every house (in the world?) that has (good?) children in it, parking his sleigh pulled by reindeer on the roof while he pops down the chimney to deliver a present for each child and to eat some cookies and drink some milk (how much?) and collect some refueling carrots for the reindeer (how many?).  He then pops back up the chimney, gets in the sleigh, calls out a merry message, and moves on to the next house.  

Through careful route planning, Santa actually has about 31 hours available to him to work (24time zones, travelling westward, he can stay in darkness for about 31 hours straight).

The story raises a number of important questions, the answers to which depend on some assumptions you would have to make, since we don’t really know how Santa works and we don’t have access to his lists or his logistics management team.  Choose one or more questions to work out, show all your work on whiteboards, making clear any assumptions you make.  (Any time you need an actual number, just estimate what that number is, and write it down)

How much time can he spend at each house?

How fast does he need to be moving between houses?

How many cookies does he get?

Is the supply of carrots enough to keep the reindeer peppy all night?

How big must the gift bag be, on the inside?

How heavy is the sleigh?
