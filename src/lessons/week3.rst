No school Wednesday, but double blocks shifted (so no Friday schedule)

Day 1
=====

0. Course Mechanics: Settting up the notes, checking your skills grades on activegrade, doing retries and makeups.  


1. The measurement game
  
    * You are going to be given a wooden dowel, which has been cut to a particular length. This dowel is your measuring device, with which you will measure a number of  objects in the room.
    * First name your measuring unit.  (As in "Stick", so you can say "the whiteboard is 21 sticks wide")  Choose a better aname than "stick".
    * Measure the height of each person in your group in your unit
    * You will need to construct auxiliary measuring devices to complete this task accurately. So you can subdivide for small objects, and so you can scale up for large ones
    * Make a partitioned unit derived from your unit
    * Make a composed unit from your unit
    * Measure: your team whiteboard (length and width), the room itself (length, width), your lab table (length and width), and a paperclip (length and width).
    * Make a table with all of your measurements, expressed in original units, in partitioned units, and in composed units.  Put it into a google doc spreadsheet which I will share with you

 2. So what are some of the lessons learned from the measurement game?
 
    * different ways to do it?
    * can we convert between different ways?
    * which way is "best"?
    * how can we tell what is best?  What does it mean for a measurement to be "better"?

Day 2 
=====


 1. Course mechanics:  Checking your notes to make sure they are done right.  Daily summaries.

 2. Enter all of your measurement data from yesterday in the google doc spreadsheet.

 3. Discussion: Within your groups there are 5 to 6 different units defined, which we've put in the google doc table.

    * What do you notice about this table?
    * What do you wonder?  (What questions can we answer about it?)

 4. Prepare instructions for your unit -- explain how to make your composed unit and your partitioned unit from the original.  Pass these to another group.  The new group should now repeat all of the measurements using your units, and figure out how to convert between the different systems.

Day 3
=====

(double block)


 1. Course mechanics: Writing a Good Summary

 2. Convert between your units and someone else's units.  ie, if the whiteboard is 10 Snoggles long, how many Werts is it?

 3. Reflection:

    * Are your measurements the same as the other group's?  If not, why not? (Did you make a mistake, or them, or what?) 
    * How do your three units compare to a standard measurement system?
    * How is using someone else's units like (or unlike) converting between standard and metric systems?
    * How did your choices for partitioning, composing, and naming make your work easier or harder?
    * What do you need in order to be able to do these computations on your own?

 4. How do we convert from one measurement system to another?  Write instructions to yourself, then convert the following:

    * There are 5.5 Snoggles in a Wert.  If the Whiteboard is 10 Werts, how many Snoggles is it?
    * If the room is 87 Snoggles, how many Werts is it?
    * If the building is 1150 Snoggles, how many Werts is it?
    * How many inches are there in a foot?
    * How many meters in a yard?
    * Convert the height 6 feet, 2 inches into:  inches, feet, meters, centimeters, miles, and furlongs.

 5. Write instructions to yourself on how to convert units.
