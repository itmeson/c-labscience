Warm Up
=======

Suppose you put a chunk of ice in water.  What will happen to the *water* and to the *ice*?  Why?  Draw pictures of what happens to individual molecules of each. 


==============
Where we Stand
==============

Salt with Boiling Water
-----------------------

If you mix salt with water, then heat it, the temperature at which the water
boils is *higher* than before.  Every group that investigated this saw the same
thing, so it seems that we have a pretty good case that *what happens* is that
salt causes the boiling temperature to increase.  Some groups found that the
time it takes to get to boiling is reduced when you add more salt, while others
did not see this effect.

- Are there other questions we need to answer about this process to understand *what happens*?  
- Are there other questions we need to answer in order to understand *why* it happens?


Ice with Water
--------------

If you mix ice with water then allow the ice to melt, partially or fully, the
final temperature of the mixture is lower than it started.  The more ice you
use, the lower the temperature gets.  Every group that investigated this saw
the same things, so, again, it seems we have a pretty good case that *what
happens* is that ice can lower the temperature of liquid water.  (Of course,
this is something we all knew already)
 
- Are there other questions we need to answer about this process to understand *what happens*?
- Are there other questions we need to answer in order to understand *why* it happens?


Ice and Salt with Water
-----------------------

If you mix ice and salt with water, then allow the ice to melt, partially or
fully, the final temperature is ??  Actually, this one was quite confusing, as
every group that investigated this process dealt with it in different ways.  It
wasn't clear what the effect on temperature was, nor the effect on the freezing
point, or the rate at which the ice melts.  This is further confused by the
fact that we all know they use salt on the roads when it is cold to help deal
with ice to make it safer to drive.  There must be a reason for that, but some
groups actually found that the presence of salt in the water caused the ice to
remain *longer*.

- Are there other questions we need to answer about this process to understand *what happens*?
- Are there other questions we need to answer in order to understand *why* it happens?




==========
What Next?
==========

If we understand *what* happened, but not *why*, then we need to focus on
digging deeper to see how the phenomena we have seen relates to other
principles.  That will help us understand *why*.

On the other hand, if we don't really understand or agree on *what* happened,
then our focus needs to be on getting more perspective on the phenomenon
itself.

**Spend some time writing into your notes your current understanding of what
happened in the cases above, and why it happened.**



Ice with Water
--------------

Our situation with the boiling water is more like the first, but the ice with
water and ice with salt and water is more like the second -- we need to do a
better job understanding *what* happened, and that requires having a better
understanding of what we should expect to see and of what we actually do see.

Imagine you mix very cold water (nearly 0C, so just about to freeze) with
lukewarm water at 30C.  The two water samples are equal masses.  **What should
you expect the equilibrium temperature to be, when they have fully mixed?**
(we have done this before, so you should be able to refer to your notes or to
your memory to figure this out, without having to actually measure it again).

Now let's actually see what the mixed temperature will be when we mix equal
masses of lukewarm water (30C) and Ice (0C).  **What is the mixed temperature
now, after the ice melts?**  

**How does the temperature compare to what you got when it was just cold water and warm water?**

Now can you more clearly explain what the phenomenon in question is?  What is
the "interesting effect" ice has on water?  Is it as simple as "more ice means
colder"?  Or is there something else going on?


Phase Changes
-------------

An important factor in understanding what is going on with both the salt and
boiling water and the ice with water is to remember that a phase change is
occuring.  In all cases, the water molecule $H_2O$ is the same, but it's
arrangement near other water molecules is different.  When the water starts to
boil, individual molecules of $H_2O$ are leaving the liquid and escaping into
the air, where they are free to move around much in the same way that tennis
balls would move if they were shot around the inside of a room.  We all agree
from the evidence that when salt is present, the water must be at a *higher
temperature* before it starts to boil, which means that it takes *more energy*
before the molecules begin to escape.  In understanding why this phenomenon
occurs, we now know that what we have to do is understand why salt interferes
with the boiling process.

With the ice and water mixture, there is also a phase change occuring, with ice
turning to liquid, and liquid turning to solid.  What causes the ice to melt in
the ice-water mixture?  What causes warm water to cool when it comes in contact
with cooler water?  What is *different* when there is ice present, versus when
there is just cool water present?

What is it that the ice does, that is different from mixing with cool water?

   Reaction potential energies. One of these goes with reactions where the products are colder than the reactions, and the other is consistent with reactions where the products are warmer than the reactants.

**Which of these do you think matches the process of melting the ice? Why?**

Homework
========

As always, your homework is to share your notes with your teammates, edit your
own version into your own document, and write a high level summary of what we
did and why we did it.  If you are unsure what should be in your notes, please
meet with Mark as soon as possible.  We are going to work very hard on
producing *excellent* notes this term.
