Something is not right here.....

Let's figure out the mass used by Gravia.

Potential energy is PE = mgh.

For deciWatt, we have a 12 kilogram mass, lifted up to the roof (about 3 meters), on earth (g = 10 meters per second per second).  So the potential energy available to deciwatt is 12*3*10 = 360 Joules.  This energy is expended by the bulbs, producing 15 lumens of output, for 12 minutes.  This is a total energy output of 15*12 = 180 "lumen-minutes".

For Gravia, the output is 700 lumens for 4 hours, which is 700*4*60 = 168000 "lumen-minutes".  That is a MUCH bigger output than deciWatt.  It is 168000 / 180 = 933.33 -- it is 933 time larger output of energy than deciWatt.

Since it produces so much more energy than Gravia, it must have started with much more energy, right?  The only place this energy could come from is from the initial potential energy, in the height of the mass in the Gravia lamp.  So Gravia must have started with 933*360 Joules of energy = 335,880 Joules.

Gravia says that the mass is "about 4 feet high", which we'll round to 1.5 meters. So PE = 335,880 = m*10*1.5.

Solving for m, we get m = 335,880 / (15)= 22,386.7 KILOGRAMS.

What's wrong with this picture? 



Maximum output from a lamp is 683 lumens per watt (because quantum).

Using any reasonable mass number, that could actually be lifted by a person in a short amount of time, this lamp is outputting 50 - 1000 times more energy than is put into it.

MAGIC.


So, which company should you invest in?

Obviously, Gravia.  If their device does work, you should definitely put your money with people who can do magic.
