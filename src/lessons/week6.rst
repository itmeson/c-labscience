:summary: Continuing practice and development of concepts about significant digits, scientific notation, and measurement 
:category: lessons
:tags: scientific notation, significant digits, units, measurement


=====
Day 1
=====

 1. Setup Week 6 notes.

 2. Continuing the Explore Learning Gizmo tool to practice unit conversion, significant digits, and scientific notation


=====
Day 2
=====

 1. More work with the Explore Learning tool.  The object of these questions is to practice unit conversion using another tool, and to begin get more comfortable with using scientific notation and the correct number of significant digits to represent measurements.

 2. Why do significant digits matter, anyway?


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. Warmup with conversion practice -- quiz on Friday!

 2. There are many different ways to represent data, each of which can tell us different things about the data and about the relationships present between different factors in the data.  Most of you know that for most people, your wingspan (the distance from fingertip to fingertip if you stretch your arms out horizontally) is about equal to your height -- though not for everybody (Mark's wingspan is about 6 inches more than his height).  We're going to test out this idea by measuring, and then we'll use graphs to look at the results to decide whether or not it is generally true.

 3. Graph the data, and decide how to tell whether our data supports the prediction that wingspan and height are about equal.


=====
Day 4
=====

 1. Quiz on unit conversion, signficant digits, and scientific notation

 2. Discussion about writing good notes and summaries

 3. Veritasium video on how units are defined:
