 4. What do you have to do with the ramp (inclined plane) to reduce the force required to lift the mass?

 5. Suppose you wanted to lift an object to a height of 100 meters.  What would you have to do with the ramp to be able to do that, if you want the required force to be as small as possible?

Day 2
=====

 1. Comparing the tradeoffs between ramps, levers, and pulleys


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. The potential energy is the *same* no matter how you lift something, as long as you lift it to the same height.  This explains why there is a tradeoff between the force applied by a machine and the distance through which you have to pull it. 

 2. Introducing the Rube Goldberg project
