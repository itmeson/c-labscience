Day 2
=====

 1. How much fresh water is available on the planet?  

	a. Make a copy of this `spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DN1g23qOluTbih9SmhGBVIGbcMiERvCRHYENb2oQq-U/edit#gid=0>`_
	b. If we pretended there was exactly 1.3 Liters of water on earth, how much of it would be freshwater?  Ground water? Surface water?  
	c. Use the data in the spreadsheet to do a unit conversion to figure this out.

 2. Where is the water `being used? <http://www.worldmapper.org/images/largepng/104.png>`_

 3. Describe the distribution of water on the planet.  Is most of it fresh? Salt? On the surface? In the ground?

 3. Which areas of the world use the most water? Which use the least?

 5. Which areas use more or less water than you would expect them to, based on population?

 6. In which areas do you expect a lack of water to cause the biggest challenges for the people living there?  Why do you give this answer?

 7. Can we store more `freshwater? <http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/humans-are-draining-even-more-earths-freshwater-we-thought-180957444/?no-ist>`_

Day 3

 1.  `Salt and conductivity data collection <https://docs.google.com/a/seattleacademy.org/spreadsheets/d/1q5lD-59OSKVJZzBkkC7cZwKpXkVUrf5GaVB1NyS7QB4/edit?usp=sharing>`_
 

 2. **Reading assignment for Friday**: Here are some articles about desalination and its role in generating water for humans to use. 

This is an `NPR piece <http://www.npr.org/2015/04/16/400052246/will-desalination-plants-cure-calif-drought-issues-or-enable-more-growth>`_ that talks about the pros and cons.  Two articles about projects in California, one opinion piece from the LA Times  `arguing against <http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-20150426-column.html>`_ desalination plants and then an article talking about the plans for a plant in the `Catalina Islands <http://abc7.com/news/catalina-island-fights-drought-with-new-desalination-plant/1104735/>`_.  Finally, this article described the measures `Australia <http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-australia-can-teach-the-world-about-surviving-drought/>`_ took to deal with its water crisis and how the reduction measures made their desal plans unnecessary.
