Unit conversion practice.  (Mark was out sick today)

 1.  How many cubic centimeters are there in a cubic meter?

 2.  If a waterfall is flowing at a rate of 10 cubic yards per second, how many cubic meters of water go over the falls every day?

 3.  A Prius can travel about 50 miles on a single gallon of gas.  A Hummer H2 can travel about 11 miles on a single gallon of gas.  How many gallons of gas will each vehicle use to travel 720 miles?  How much will it cost to get the gas, if gas costs $3.85 per gallon.

 4.  Look up the conversion from gallons to cubic meters.  How much does gasoline cost per cubic meter?

 5.  In Europe, fuel efficiency is quoted in Liters per Kilometer.  If the Prius gets 50 miles per gallon, what is its efficiency in Liters per Kilometer?  

 6.  Which is better, 20 Liters per kilometer, or 10 Liters per kilometer? Why?

(Mark was out sick today too)

 1. Use the ExploreLearning website (`explorelearning.com <http://explorelearning.com/>`_) to practice unit conversion along with significant digits and scientific notation.

 2. What is the point of signficant digits?  To avoid seeming either pretentious or clueless -- if you measure something using a tool that is only accurate to 3 digits, there is no way you can make a calculation with that number that is any more precise than those 3 digits, even if the calculator gives you a lot more digits.
