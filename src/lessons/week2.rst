 1. Set up notes, Block_sweek2_coolName

 2. Reminder that week 1 notes and summaries are due today,and will be graded tomorrow.

 3. There will be a quiz this week, on Friday.

 4. What is temperature?  Write your best understanding right now.  (Why do I keep asking the same question?  Because your answer should be changing as we get more information and more insight into what is going on.)

 5. Let's take a look at the Gas Properties simulation together.  We've already observed that adding or removing heat changes the speed of the particles,right?  Well I want you to measure precisely how that changes the speed.  So you are going to control the temperature very carefully, and measure the speed of the particle as you increase the temp from 20K to 40 K to 60K, etc., all the way up to 500 K.  Good?

 6.  How are you going to measure the speed?

Day 2

 7. Now that that's done, intepret the graph that you produce -- what is the relationship between temperature and speed?

 8. Now what about particle type?  Compare how the blue particle and red particle move at the same temperature.  Change the temperature, and decide how to represent how the two particle speeds change.  What is *constant*?

 9. It's time to figure out the equation that relates the temperature to the properties of the particle.  

 10. In the energy skate park, figure out all the ways you can increase the total energy of the skater.  How does the simulation show that the total energy has increased?  How many ways can you increase *just* the kinetic energy?  What about *just* the potential energy? 

 9.  Now put lots of particles in the box.  Are they all moving at the same speed?  Why not?

 10.  Which particle determines the temperature?

 11.  Now go back to the reversible reactions simulation and put a bunch of particles on the left side.  How many of them have enough energy to make it over the hill?  Why?

 12.  What is temperature? 

 13. Put one particle in the Reversible Reactions simulation, and adjust the heights of the two sides to make the particle move faster on one side than on the other.  Now make a skate track in the Energy Skate Park: Basics

   "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms â€” little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied." ... Richard Feynman, Nobel Laureate in Physics
