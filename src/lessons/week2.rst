Day 1
=====

 1. Discussion of the "`Cuckoo Conundrum <http://www.npr.org/2014/03/20/291977035/this-freeloading-bird-brings-help-and-the-help-smells-gross>`_".  The story mentions two different surprising things that were noticed about the relationship between cuckoos and crows.  What were they?  What ideas did they have to explain those surprises?  What experiments did they do to test those ideas?

 2. Introducing dot maps / motion maps.

Day 2
=====

 1. Worksheet exploring constructing motion maps.  So far we have used graphs of position vs.time and of speed (or velocity) vs. time to represent motion.  The motion map / dot graph is a third way.  **Why is it useful to have multiple ways to represent motion?**

 2. A motion map shows the motion as though you had taken a series of images of the object moving at fixed time intervals -- like a flash on a camera that keeps flashing once per second.  Every time the camera flashes, another image is recorded.  You put a dot in the location of the object after each flash.  Describe the motion of the object that is given by the map below: (is it a constant speed?  Is it speeding up or slowing down? What direction is it moving?)

 3. The worksheet gives you several tables of position and time values, and asks you to make the distance/time graph and the motion map so you can compare the different representations.

 2. When does C catch up to D?  (or is it D catching up to C?)

 3. I've shared the anonymized `rainfall data <https://docs.google.com/a/seattleacademy.org/spreadsheets/d/1qK5uRRO4nn6qlEk2Esxr530RJ1E8pHrMQRu8QwVK6Dk/edit?usp=sharing>`_ with you here (you must be logged in with your SAAS account to use this link).  Take a look at the data and, with your group, begin to formulate several questions about the data set or about the rainfall that you could answer using the data and your own analysis work.  We will begin doing this analysis next week.
