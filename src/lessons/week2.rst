  1. Setup notes

  2. `Logger Pro instruction <http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/abp/TPProbs/Problems/K/Logger%20Pro%20Instructions.pdf>`_  This document is from a physics class at University of Maryland, explaining how to use Logger Pro to track the motion of an object in a video, to produce graphs of that motion, and to find the velocity of that motion.  We are going to use this to measure velocities and changes of velocities after collisions.  Start with the video of a blow-dart `here <https://serc.s3.amazonaws.com/files/sp/library/direct_measurement_video/direct_measurement_video_blowd.mov?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22direct_measurement_video_blowd.mov%22&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJNREQ3H4ZIYN7ZAA&Expires=1767644965&Signature=eVedpgWzhOVbU4wh1cVz4nszoZ8%3D>`_
