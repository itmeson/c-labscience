Day 1
=====

 1. Course mechanics: Taking Good Notes

 2. Measuring area, identify needed tools, use your units from last week to make square units

 3. Questions:

    * How many square partitioned units are there in a square original unit?
    * How many square original units in a square composed unit?
    * How many square partitioned units in a square composed unit?
    * How do you know?

 4. What would happen to your measurements of the area if your constructed square unit was off a little bit?

Day 2
=====

 1. Course mechanics: Retakes and Grading

 2. How bad is it if you get a measurement wrong?  Read the following article_ and help your notetaker summarize it in the notes.

 3. We're going to find out just how bad it can be by trying several different methods of measuring out the recommended dose for cough syrup -- 4 teaspoons.

    * using the provided measuring cup
    * using a kitchen teaspoon
    * using a kitchen spoon
    * using a graduated cylinder
    * using a balance

 4. Which way is the most reliable?  Why?

 5. How far off could your measurement be using each of the methods?

 6. Even perfectly performed measurements *always* have some uncertainty.  You measured 3 centimeters, but was it exactly 3?  Or 3.1? 3.01? 3.005?  How can you tell?

 7. Are you a bad person if your measurement is uncertain?

Day 3

 1. A little history: for scientific purposes we care about definitions of units because we need to get as exact an answer as possible, but historically it was more about business.  Consider the teaspoon, tablespoon, the dram, the cup, the pint, the quart, gallon, minim, barrel, cord, peck, bushel, and the hogshead.  In fact, in your groups, pick one each of these traditional units, look them up, then prepare to explain them to the rest of us.

 2. Reflection:

    * What is up with all those units?  Why were there so many?  Why is it so hard to figure out what they mean/meant?
    * What is required to make a "good" system of units?

 3. (just the first 12 minutes for us today, though the rest is very interesting too):
