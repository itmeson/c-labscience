Day 1

 1. How can you tell whether or not the "constant velocity car" is really moving at a constant velocity?  Do new measurements that will help us decide.

 2. How can we tell visually if the data supports constant velocity?  Graph it.  What you want is a graph of all your trials together, so you can see if the measurements were consistent with each other, and then you want one graph with the averages from each trial so you can see something about the changes in speed.  The first graph tells you something about the *reliability* of your results.  The second tells you what the result is.

 3. So, if you graph Distance travelled on the y-axis, and Time on the x-axis, what should you see if the car is moving at a constant speed?  Since Speed is the distance travelled divided by the amount of time it takes, then you should see that if the car moved 10 centimeters in the first 0.2 seconds, then it should travel 10 centimeters in the next 0.2 seconds, and the next, and that it should travel 50 centimeters in one second  --- it should have a *constant slope*.  If, on the other hand, the graph looks jagged or curvy, meaning that the slope has changed, then you can tell that the speed *wasn't* constant.

Day 2
=====

 1. How do you actually make the graphs of your data from the car?  We used desmos, google docs spreadsheets, and excel to make our graphs, and it took quite a bit of time to fuss around with the details.  Make sure your notes include instructions as to how you actually made your group's graphs.

Day 3
=====

 1. Now we're trying to get a more formal understanding of the relationship between speed, distance travelled, and the graphs you get from data about motion.  We worked on several different worksheets that took us through developing this understanding.  (The worksheets are copyrighted, so they can't be posted online -- if you need a new copy send Mark a note)

 2. Make a graph showing the Position and Time of Mark as he walks around the room.
