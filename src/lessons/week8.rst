 0. Setup week 8 notes

 1. Finish data taking and graphing for the simulation experiment, looking at relationship between force and acceleration.  Normally, you graph the thing you are changing yourself on the x-axis, and the thing you are measuring, that is changing *because* of the one you control, on the y-axis.  For this experiment, I'd like you to flip that (it will be easier to interpret the results).  So put the Force (which you are controlling) on the  y-axis, and put the acceleration ( which you are measuring, and which is changing *because* of the changes in force) on the x-axis.

 2. Do curve fits for each of the data sets.  When you do curve fits, you should start with the simplest curve possible -- a line.  If it fits the data well, then you are done.  If it doesn't, then move to more complicated candidates for the curve fit, by trying quadratics, higher polynomials, inverses, etc.  For this question, you will find that a line does a really good job.  

 3. What is the slope of each line you get?

 4. What is the y-intercept of each line?  What *should* the y-intercept be?

 5. Do you notice any relationship between the slope of the line and the mass of the object that corresponds to that line?

 1. Finish making graphs for the force - acceleration simulation

 2. Okay, now let's talk about these results.  If the graph is difficult to read, click the "Play with this data" link to view it in a separate tab.

 3.  Notice that there are 4 straight lines, each of which is a curve fit to the data obtained from the simulation.  The y-axis of the graph is the **Force** (F), and the x-axis is the **Acceleration** (a).  Since 

:math:`\begin{eqnarray} 
y & = & mx + b \\
F & = & ?? a +?? \end{eqnarray}`

the question marks are there to indicate that those are the parts of the equation we are trying to find.  Since the equation of a line has to be :math:`y=mx+b`, we know that there must be a straight line equation for the relationship between the force and the acceleration -- we just need to find out what the slope and the y-intercept are.

 4. Look at the graph -- each of the lines looks like it would go through the origin if you extended it backward.  And the y-intercept values are very small, compared to the slope -- they are close to zero.  Does that make sense?  What would it mean if the y-intercept was 10?  What would it mean if the y-intercept was negative ten (-10) ?

The y-intercept is the y-value when the x-value is zero.  So for this graph, that would be the force when the acceleration is zero.  We already know that what forces do is cause acceleration (changes in speed).  Does it make sense to have a force that isn't zero, when the acceleration *is* zero?

No.  No it doesn't.  If there is a net force acting on the object, then there must be an acceleration.  That is what forces do.

 5. Conclusion?  The **b** value in the equation above must be zero.  It doesn't make sense for it to be anything else.  The reason the curve-fits don't have y-intercepts exactly equal to zero is measurement uncertainty, and the difficulty of increasing the force instantly in the simulation.

 6. So what about the slope.  The number for the slopes seem to be random.  Are they?

 7. I notice that the slope for the 100 kilogram mass is twice is high as the slope for the 50 kilogram mass.  And the 200 kilogram mass has a slope that is twice as high again.  




y = mx + b -- slope is the number next to the x.

Notice a relationship between the mass and the fit parameters? Bigger the mass, the bigger the slope. Is it a perfect proportion?

Is the slope for the 200 kg curve twice as big as the slope for the 100 kg curve?

Yes?

Then F = ma

3. Choose sims from motion tab in PhET, play, write questions. Share at least three questions that you could investigate more fully with me through email

Day 3
=====

 1. Fully develop on investigation into one of the simulations from PhET, as assigned.  You will be assigned one of the following:

  a. Buoyancy Lab
  b. Collision Lab
  c. Gravity Force Lab
  d. Forces & Motion (Basics) (using friction)
  e. Projectile Lab

Your job is to investigate the phenomenon in your simulation, then formulate instructions that another lab group will follow to understand what you have figured out about your phenomenon.
