Day 1 and 2
===========

**Q Warmup" Suppose you put a chunk of ice in water.  What will happen to the *water* and to the *ice*?  Why?  Draw pictures of what happens to individual molecules of each.** 

Salt with Boiling Water
-----------------------

If you mix salt with water, then heat it, the temperature at which the water
boils is *higher* than before.  Every group that investigated this saw the same
thing, so it seems that we have a pretty good case that *what happens* is that
salt causes the boiling temperature to increase.  Some groups found that the
time it takes to get to boiling is reduced when you add more salt, while others
did not see this effect.

**Q1 Are there other questions we need to answer about this process to understand what happens?**  
**Q2 Are there other questions we need to answer in order to understand why it happens?**


Ice with Water
--------------

If you mix ice with water then allow the ice to melt, partially or fully, the
final temperature of the mixture is lower than it started.  The more ice you
use, the lower the temperature gets.  Every group that investigated this saw
the same things, so, again, it seems we have a pretty good case that *what
happens* is that ice can lower the temperature of liquid water.  (Of course,
this is something we all knew already)
 
**Q3 Are there other questions we need to answer about this process to understand *what happens*?**
**Q4 Are there other questions we need to answer in order to understand *why* it happens?**


Ice and Salt with Water
-----------------------

If you mix ice and salt with water, then allow the ice to melt, partially or
fully, the final temperature is ??  Actually, this one was quite confusing, as
every group that investigated this process dealt with it in different ways.  It
wasn't clear what the effect on temperature was, nor the effect on the freezing
point, or the rate at which the ice melts.  This is further confused by the
fact that we all know they use salt on the roads when it is cold to help deal
with ice to make it safer to drive.  There must be a reason for that, but some
groups actually found that the presence of salt in the water caused the ice to
remain *longer*.

**Q5 Are there other questions we need to answer about this process to understand *what happens*?**
**Q6 Are there other questions we need to answer in order to understand *why* it happens?**


If we understand *what* happened, but not *why*, then we need to focus on
digging deeper to see how the phenomena we have seen relates to other
principles.  That will help us understand *why*.

On the other hand, if we don't really understand or agree on *what* happened,
then our focus needs to be on getting more perspective on the phenomenon
itself.

**Q7 Spend some time writing into your notes your current understanding of what
happened in the cases above, and why it happened.**



Ice with Water
--------------

Our situation with the boiling water is more like the first, but the ice with
water and ice with salt and water is more like the second -- we need to do a
better job understanding *what* happened, and that requires having a better
understanding of what we should expect to see and of what we actually do see.

Imagine you mix very cold water (nearly 0C, so just about to freeze) with
lukewarm water at 30C.  The two water samples are equal masses.  

**Q8 What should you expect the equilibrium temperature to be, when they have fully mixed?**

(we have done this before, so you should be able to refer to your notes or to
your memory to figure this out, without having to actually measure it again).

Now let's actually see what the mixed temperature will be when we mix equal
masses of lukewarm water (30C) and Ice (0C).  

**Q9 What is the mixed temperature now, after the ice melts?**  

**Q10 How does the temperature compare to what you got when it was just cold water and warm water?**

Now can you more clearly explain what the phenomenon in question is?  What is
the "interesting effect" ice has on water?  Is it as simple as "more ice means
colder"?  Or is there something else going on?


Phase Changes
-------------

An important factor in understanding what is going on with both the salt and
boiling water and the ice with water is to remember that a phase change is
occuring.  In all cases, the water molecule $H_2O$ is the same, but it's
arrangement near other water molecules is different.  When the water starts to
boil, individual molecules of $H_2O$ are leaving the liquid and escaping into
the air, where they are free to move around much in the same way that tennis
balls would move if they were shot around the inside of a room.  We all agree
from the evidence that when salt is present, the water must be at a *higher
temperature* before it starts to boil, which means that it takes *more energy*
before the molecules begin to escape.  In understanding why this phenomenon
occurs, we now know that what we have to do is understand why salt interferes
with the boiling process.

With the ice and water mixture, there is also a phase change occuring, with ice
turning to liquid, and liquid turning to solid.  What causes the ice to melt in
the ice-water mixture?  What causes warm water to cool when it comes in contact
with cooler water?  What is *different* when there is ice present, versus when
there is just cool water present?

What is it that the ice does, that is different from mixing with cool water?

   Reaction potential energies. One of these goes with reactions where the products are colder than the reactions, and the other is consistent with reactions where the products are warmer than the reactants.

**Q11 Which of these do you think matches the process of melting the ice? Why?**


As always, your homework is to share your notes with your teammates, edit your
own version into your own document, and write a high level summary of what we
did and why we did it.  If you are unsure what should be in your notes, please
meet with Mark as soon as possible.  We are going to work very hard on
producing *excellent* notes this term.

Day 3

*This was a Friday schedule on a Thursday this week.*

Ice with water
--------------

We saw yesterday that when you mix equal masses of warm water with cold water,
the equilibrium temperature reached is equal to the midpoint of the two
temperatures.  You also saw a couple of weeks ago that when the masses are
different, the equilibrium temperature is equal to the *weighted* average of
the temperatures, like this:

$$\\begin{equation}
T_{new} = \\frac{m_{cold}T_{cold} + m_{warm}T_{warm}}{m_{cold} + m_{warm}}
\\end{equation}
$$

The reason this works is that when two molecules collide, if one of the
molecules loses energy, the other one picks up exactly the amount that was lost
(energy is *conserved*).  So as the molecules of the warmer water collide with
more and more of the molecules of the colder water, on average the warmer water
*cools down* and the cooler water *warms up*.  The exact amount of kinetic
energy that the cold water picks up is precisely equal to the amount of kinetic
energy lost by the warmer water.  Thus the temperature has to "meet in the
middle".  

But an equal mass of ice mixed with the water leads to a *lower* temperature
than the weighted average.  This means that the process of melting the ice
*takes more energy* out of the warm water than does the process of mixing the
cold water in, *even if the cold water started just barely above 0C*.  

**Q1 How can that be?**  

Consider the reaction potential energy curves from Day 1.  These are
supposed to show the potential energy during a reaction, the left side of the
plot showing the potential energy for the reactants (before the change) and the
right side showing the potential enegy for the products (after the change).
The *ice gets warmer* during the mixing, and the *water gets colder*.  

**Q2 Does the potential energy of the water change when it loses or gains kinetic energy?**

**Q3 Does the potential energy of the ice change when it melts?**

**Q4 Does the potential energy of the water change when it freezes?**

In the ice-water mixture, there are three different ways we can break up the
"system" -- there is the ice by itself.  There is the water by itself, and
there is the whole ice-water system. 
 
**Q5 Does the total energy of the ice-water system change when you mix them together?**

**Q6 Does the total energy of the ice by itself change, when you mix it with the water?**

**Q7 Does the total energy of the water by itself change, when you mix it with the ice?**

Draw diagrams for each of the system components, showing the energy going in
and out of each piece.  What form is this energy in? (potential, kinetic,
total)  I am basically asking -- 

**Q8 How does the energy of each piece of the system change when you mix them together?**


Remember that a chemical bond is like a spring connecting two atoms together.
When a chemical change occurs, some bonds are broken and/or new ones are
formed.  The new bonds usually do not have the same springiness.  A tighter
bond is one with higher potential energy, and therefore lower kinetic energy
(the energy is stored in the bond, rather than in the motion of the particles).
In a looser bond / looser spring, the bond has lower potential energy and
therefore higher kinetic energy (the energy is stored in the motion of the
particles, rather than in the bonds).

Melting ice involves breaking apart moderately weak bonds / attractions between
different $H_2O$ molecules. 

**Q9 If a bond is broken, what does this imply about the potential energy of the
$H_2O$ molecules that started as ice before and after the melting?**

**Q10 What does this imply about the potential energy of $H_2O$ molecules that
start as water before and after freezing?**

**Q11 What does this imply about the kinetic energy of the $H_2O$ molecules?**

Spring Quiz 1


So what does the salt do?
-------------------------

We know that the salt increases the boiling point and also lowers the freezing
point.  This is the only way to explain what we saw when we added salt to the
ice or to the hot water.  Somehow the salt makes it harder for water molecules
to escape the liquid surface when you heat it up -- the fact that the
temperature is higher when it boils means that the water molecules need more
energy to escape when there is salt than they do when there is no salt.

Conversely, the salt makes it *easier* for the water molecules to escape from
the ice, because the lower freezing point means that they need less energy to
get away from the ice surface when there is salt than they do when there is no
salt.

We also know that salt dissolved in water will cause the temperature of the
water to decrease, in the same way that ammonium chloride (instant ice-packs)
causes the temperature to decrease when dissolved in water.

**Q1 What does this fact about the temperature when you dissolve salt in water
tell you about the potential energy curve for salt dissolving in water?**


But the fact that salt lowers the temperature of water, by itself does not
explain why salt lowers the freezing point or increases the boiling point (and
it contradicts the fact that the *time* it takes to boil decreases with the
salt). 

Let's think about this in terms of the potential energy curves.

**Q2 Draw (again) the potential energy curve for the transition from ice to liquid
water**

**Q3 Now think about the fact that salt makes the freezing point decrease, which
means that the liquid water produced when the ice melts will be *colder* than
0C -- how must the potential energy curve change when you add the salt?**

**Q4 Now draw (again) the potential energy curve for the transition from liquid
water to steam (boiling)**

**Q5 Think about the fact that the salt makes the boiling point increase, which
means that the steam produced when the water boils will be *hotter* than 100C
-- how must the potential energy curve change when you add the salt?**
