 3. We're going to do a research project -- investigating the issues around a particular energy resource, and presenting the results and issues to the rest of the class.  Your work should take the form of a debate -- which ennergy source is "best"?  Why?  What are the benefits and drawbacks of your resource?

 4. Research time.
