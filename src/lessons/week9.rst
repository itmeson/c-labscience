=====
Day 1
=====

 1. New groups, set up notes

 2. Finish constant velocity worksheet from Friday.  We are trying to understand the connection between speed and slope.

 3. Some practice rates calculations

 4. Make another Mark-graph.  Mark is moving at constant speeds by controlling his number of steps per second and the length of his steps (the number of feet per step).  This suggests a way of understanding his speed by setting up a conversion problem:

====== =======
3 feet 2 steps
step   second
====== =======

gives 6 feet per second.

Day 2
=====

 1. Another MarkGraph

 2. Make graphs of Position vs. Time that someone else will have to act out.

 3. Consider this image of three cooking pots, placed in a rainstorm to collect water.  If the rain is steady and uniform for about 6 hours, which of the three will have the greatest *height* of water?

 4. Look at rain gauge instructions and images.  Please bring in an empty one liter bottle -- this will be the cheapest and most environmentally friendly way to put rain gauges at every home in the class.

Day 3
=====

 1. Construct a graph of Position vs. Time for Mark's motion through the room, if he takes 1 step each second, but each step gets longer -- the first step is 1 foot, the second step is 2 feet, the third step is 3 feet, and so on up to the sixth step at 6 feet.

 2. Begin building rain gauges.  The gauge needs to have a constant surface area down the entire length to make comparison of our measurements as simple as possible.  Cut the top off the bottle, invert the top and tape it in place upside down to serve as a funnel.  Measure the diameter of the funnel and record it.  Place masking tape along the side, use a fine-point permanent marker to mark ruler lines on the tape with the smallest divisions no more than one quarter centimeter.

Day 4

 1. Quiz5_

 2. What do you do when you don't know how to even start a problem? 

 **Guess**.   

 Why?  Because if you are lost and staring at a blank piece of paper, you will keep staring at the blank piece of paper forever.  But if you make a guess, you are forced to guess an answer that has the right form.  A number usually.  And then you can start asking questions about your guess.  *Is it big enough?  Too big? What should its units be? How do I check if it's right? Oh, I see now, I can make a better guess by looking at the graph first ...*    --- or something like that.  The act of guessing allows your brain to focus on *something*, and even though that something is probably wrong, it is very likely to be wrong in a *useful way*.
