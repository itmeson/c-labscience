Suppose you put a chunk of ice in water.  What will happen to the temperature of the *water*?  Why?


==============
Today's Topics
==============

1. Recall from the simulation that some reactions cause the temperature to decrease, and some
cause it to increase.  You noticed that whenever the potential energy curve for the reaction
ends up lower than it started, the temperature increases, and that whenever the potential energy curve
ends up higer than it started, the temperature decreases.  *Why*?

2. Many of your answers are of the form, "It decreases because it gets colder" or "It decreases
because the molecules are moving slower" -- both of which are true, but which don't really illuminate
the question any more.  The second answer is better than the first, because it at least shows
an understanding that the motion of the molecules is directly connected to the temperature.  We still
need a *better* answer to this question.  Further, we need to better understand the relationship
between the sources of energy we put in or take out of a system, and how much the temperature changes.

3. So I would like you to answer for me, "How *fast* does the temperature of a beaker of water change 
as you heat it with a hot plate?" Is the temperature change linear?  Curved? Does it have peaks, valleys, and dips? Does it always increase?  

  a) So put a beaker of water on a hot plate, and measure the temperature at 30 second intervals until it has been boiling for two minutes.  
  b) Make a graph, write down what you notice about the graph

4. While you are waiting for the water to boil, (the notetaker and one other should work on the water boiling) the other members of your group should be predicting what the "final" temperature will be if you mix together the following:

  a) 100 grams water at 10C with 100 grams water at 50C
  b) 200 grams water at 10C with 200 grams water at 90C
  c) 100 grams water at 10C with 50 grams water at 10C
  d) 100 grams water at 10C with 50 grams water at 80C
  e) 100 grams water at 10C with 200 grams water at 50C
  f) 100 grams *ice* with 100 grams water at 50C

5.  If there is time, you will be testing these predictions today, though more likely you will be testing them tomorrow.

6.  What have you discovered is the *rule* for how the temperature changes if you heat something?  What is the rule for how temperature changes if you mix two substances together?
