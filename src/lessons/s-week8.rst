.. There are a lot of different energy sources

Last week we figured out how much energy is required to move a car 100 meters,
then worked out how much that energy would cost using various energy sources.
We found that Coal was cheaper than Gasoline, which was cheaper than
Electricity, which was cheaper than Food, which was cheaper than AA batteries.
There are other factors that matter other than the cost, but cost is a useful
first step in deciding what energy source to use for a given task.

Today we're going to work out a couple more energy sources, then begin to look at some of those
other factors.

**Q1**: How much would it cost to move a car 100 meters using the energy released by burning wood?

**Q2**: What about charcoal?

**Q3**: How about hydro power?  How much water would you have to drop to get the hydro power?


For each of the previous energy sources (and the ones we discussed last week), write down
some important considerations (other than cost).

Day 2

.. Watts Versus Joules:  Power Availability

Last week we figured out that it would cost more than $20 to use AA batteries
to move the car.  This is so much more expensive than the other options that it
is almost silly to have even considered it.  And yet we *do* use AA batteries.
A *lot* of them.  **WHY?**

An electricity bill is quantified in the units *kilowatt-hours*

**Q2**:  What does this unit mean?  How much does one of these units cost?  How many joules is that?

**Q3**:  If you left your front light on all the time, how much would it cost per day?  Per month?

**Q4**:  How much does the electricity to charge your cell phone cost?  Should coffee shops charge customers for the electricity they use?

Day 3

.. Watts Versus Joules:  Power Availability

If you had perfect solar cells that could extract all the energy coming from the sun, how much of your house
would you have to cover to get all of your energy needs for a day?


.. **Q1**: How much solar energy is there for every square meter of the planet?

.. **Q2**: How long would you need to charge a 1 square meter solar cell to move the car 100 meters?

.. **Q3**: How much energy do you (and your family) use, TOTAL, every day?

.. **Q4**: So how much area of solar cells would you need?  Consider both peak use and average use.  Can you do it? (ie, is there enough room on your own property?)
