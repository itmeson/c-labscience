1. Gas laws simulation
----------------------


http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/gas-properties.  This simulation requires that Java be installed locally (https://www.java.com/en/download/)

Put one particle in the box, observe its motion.  Describe its motion here, including the path it takes, its speed, and what happens when it hits walls: 


How does the motion of the particle change when you increase the temperature?


How does the motion of the particle change when you decrease the temperature?


Determine the relationship between temperature and speed.  
What do you predict the relationship to be?  Linear, non-linear, etc.

Put one particle in box, and measure using “Measurement Tools > Species Information” to get exact speeds for many temperatures, produce graph. Insert the graph below.  

Repeat using the “Light species” (red particles)  What is different between the two kinds of particles in how they respond to temperature?


Explore what happens when you have more than one type of molecule in the box. Fill the box with red and blue molecules and describe how each behave.  

 
Gas laws in the context of a world with gravity. 
------------------------------------------------

Put one particle in the box, and turn gravity on.  What do you predict for the motion of the particle?  What do you observe? 

Compare the motion of the gas particle to the motion of a pendulum, spring, or skater on a half-pipe.  How is it different?  http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/energy-skate-park-basics/latest/energy-skate-park-basics_en.html

What do you think will happen if we put a lot of particles in the box at once, with gravity on?  

Put many particles in the box, and cool the box down significantly.  What do you think  will happen?  What actually happens?

Put many particles in the box, and heat the box significantly.  What do you think will happen?  What actually happens?
