:summary: How do objects fall?
:category: lessons
:tags: falling, acceleration, motion


=====
Day 1
=====

 1. Construct a Position vs. Time graph and a motion map that matches the following `Velocity vs. Time graph <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mh0eijy1j7>`_


 2. We watched a short clip from the movie **Journey to the Center of the Earth** in which the protagonist drops a glowstick into a very deep cave, and counts 3 seconds until they hear the stick splash into water below.  We are going to figure out how deep the cave is, using just this information.... but we don't know how objects fall, do we?

 3. Do objects fall at a constant speed?  (We already know that they don't -- they speed up as they fall)

 4. Can we do measurements, in the classroom, that will allow us to understand how the speed of an object changes as it falls?  How can we do that, in a way that gives us information about how the speed is changing?

Day 2
=====

 1. Continuing our project to measure how an object falls, so we can answer the question, "How deep is that cave?"

 2. Consider the Desmos graph linked `here <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w9y6atqttk>`_.  How do you measure the speed of the object represented by that line?

 3. Consider this `graph <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/t0ecok145n>`_, which shows a curve more like the one that you will find for the falling object -- how do you measure the speed of that object exactly 1 second after it starts to fall?

 4. Moral:  **Figure out how to measure how far the object has fallen  in time intervals that are as short as you can possibly manage** If you use larger time gaps between measurements, you will get wildly misleading results for how the speed of the object is changing.  The best way we have available in the room is to use the high speed mode on the cameras on your phones -- which can get up to 240 frames per second.

Day 3
=====

 1. Quiz on using Velocity vs. Time graphs to construct position vs. time and motion maps

 2. Formal lab report for the falling object lab will be due next week -- we will have significant time in class to work on it today and Monday.
