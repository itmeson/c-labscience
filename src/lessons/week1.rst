=====
Day 1
=====

 1. New groups, setup winter week 1 notes and summaries.  Revisit expectations for good notes and good summaries.

 2. Drawing Input - Output diagrams.

  a. Draw a diagram showing the inputs and outputs to and from a bank account

  b. Draw a diagram showing the input and outputs to and from a taco truck

  c. Draw a diagram showing the inputs and outputs to and from a coffee shop 

 3. What can we learn from diagrams like these?  How do the input and output rates relate to changes of the quantity within the system?


=====
Day 2
=====

 1. Measuring speed with the collision tracks.  Produce graphs showing the motion of the cars on the tracks as they move at constant velocity, using frame-by-frame video analysis

 2. Does the velocity ever change *by itself*?  What has to happen for the velocity to change?


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. Measuring before and after velocities when there are collisions.  What do we notice?

=====
Day 4
=====

 1. Measuring before and after velocities when there are collisions.  What do we notice?

 2. Drawing input - output diagrams
