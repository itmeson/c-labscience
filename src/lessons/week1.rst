Day 1

1. About the class:  This is "Act Like a Scientist Class".  It's all about asking questions and figuring out how to go about answering them, by any means necessary.  The first thing you need, though, to be able to notice and ask interesting questions, is to measure. 

2. The measurement game
  
   * You are going to be given a wooden dowel, which has been cut to a particular length. This dowel is your measuring device, with which you will measure a number of  objects in the room.
   * First name your measuring unit.  (As in "Stick", so you can say "the whiteboard is 21 sticks wide")  Choose a better aname than "stick".
   * Measure the height of each person in your group in your unit
   * You will need to construct auxiliary measuring devices to complete this task accurately. So you can subdivide for small objects, and so you can scale up for large ones
   * Make a partitioned unit derived from your unit
   * Make a composed unit from your unit
   * Measure: your team whiteboard (length and width), the room itself (length, width, and height), and a paperclip (length and width).
   * Make a table with all of your measurements, expressed in original units, in partitioned units, and in composed units.  Put it into a google doc spreadsheet which I will share with you

3. So what are some of the lessons learned from the measurement game?

   * different ways to do it?
   * can we convert between different ways?
   * which way is "best"?
   * how can we tell what is best?  What does it mean for a measurement to be "better"?

Day 2

1. Course mechanics:  Groups.

   * Notetaker -- *only* responsible for recording questions/problems we are trying to solve, the methods employed to solve them, and any results we get.  Usually on computer
   * Manager -- makes sure everyone else is on task.  Helps notetaker figure out what to write down
   * Whiteboarder -- sketches, quick data-recording, figuring stuff out
   * Intern -- research, data entry, second computer (sometimes)

The jobs are really important to getting things done. We'll practice a lot, and
you'll get feedback on how well you are doing as a contributor to your group.
Groups will change every 2 or 3 weeks, and the jobs will cycle within the group
daily so you will all have a chance at each job in each group you are in.  Your
*manager* will get hit if you or the group is off task a lot.  I'll use Class
Dojo, similar to how Scott used it, to keep track of this.


2. Discussion: Within your groups there are 5 to 6 different units defined, which we've put in the google doc table.

   * What do you notice about this table?
   * What do you wonder?  (What questions can we answer about it?)

3. Prepare instructions for your unit -- explain how to make your composed unit and your partitioned unit from the original.  Pass these to another group.

4. In each group, using the unit that has been passed to you:

   * express relationships between your original units and these new ones
   * For each of the things we measured yesterday, make a prediction about whether the measurement in the new units will have a greater or lesser value  (DO NOT COMPUTE OR MEASURE -- JUST PREDICT -- WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU THINK AND WHY)
   * Compute your height using the new units (for each person in your group), and compute at least 6 of the measurements in the table

5.  We'll put all these new measurements in a table, and compare to the
measurements the original groups got with their units.

6. Reflection:

   * How do your three units compare to a standard measurement system?
   * How is using someone else's units like (or unlike) converting between standard and metric systems?
   * How did your choices for partitioning, composing, and naming make your work easier or harder?
   * What do you need in order to be able to do these computations on your own?

Day 3

1. Course mechanics: first quiz

Quizzes are about getting information from you about what you understand and
don't understand, and giving information back to you about what you need to
still work on.  If you don't get something on the first try, you should *try
again*.  The grading system is setup to give you incentives to keep trying
until you get it.  Quizzes will usually be in class on Fridays, often using
google forms, and they will be tagged to show the specific skills that I am
looking for that day.

2. So far we've only measured *lengths*.  What are some other kinds of quantity
that we might measure?


3. Fraction and conversion review.  Prepare instructions to yourself that
explain how to convert between different units
 

4. What are the most important issues in making a "good" measurement?
