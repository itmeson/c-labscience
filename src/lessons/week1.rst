=====
Day 1
=====

 1. How much water is this? (Break into groups of 2 or 3, take water sample, and come up with at least two ways to measure how much is there.  Prepare a whiteboardthat explains your method, and be prepared to present to the class.)
 2. Do sign-in on smartboard
 3. Fill out index card:
    Name
    Previous school
    Favorite subject
    Burning question
    Anything you want me to know about you
 4. About the class:  This is "Act Like a Scientist Class".  It's all about asking questions and figuring out how to go about answering them.  While it's nice to get the answers right, that is only a secondary concern here, and we really cherish mistakes because they help us grow more than anything else.
 5. So what are some of the lessons learned from measuring the water?
    different ways to do it
    can we convert between different ways?
    which way is "best"?
    how can we tell what is best?  What does it mean for a measurement to be "better"?

Day 2 
=====


1. Measure everything in the room.  Come up with multiple ways to measure the same thing, and devise ways to reliably convert between the different ways to measure.

2. Discussion:  What are the categories of measurement that you've employed?

   time
   length
   speed
   mass
   volume
   height
   width
   temperature
   light
   ???

3. What are the most important issues in making a "good" measurement?

   same every time
   the "right" result
   easy to do
   cheap
   useful
   presentable /understandable


=====
Day 3 
=====

1. Hand out graph examples -- in groups of two or three, interpret the graphs, draw out explanations of the story on whiteboard, and act them out for the class.

2. Construct new graphs with at least two "characters", hand them to another group to decipher and act out.

3. Do the first exercise of the Function Carnival_  (input the code b6wz when prompted)


1. Find an example of a graphic (online or elsewhere) that communicates something complex.  Post the image and a question about it on the twitter feed.
