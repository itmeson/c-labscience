 1. The measurement game

 2. Fill out index card:
    Name
    Previous school
    Favorite subject
    Burning question
    Anything you want me to know about you

 3. About the class:  This is "Act Like a Scientist Class".  It's all about asking questions and figuring out how to go about answering them.  While it's nice to get the answers right, that is only a secondary concern here, and we really cherish mistakes because they help us grow more than anything else.

 4. So what are some of the lessons learned from the measurement game?
    different ways to do it
    can we convert between different ways?
    which way is "best"?
    how can we tell what is best?  What does it mean for a measurement to be "better"?
