Day 1

1. The measurement game
  
   * You are going to be given a wooden dowel, which has been cut to a particular length. This dowel is your measuring device, with which you will measure a number of  objects in the room.
   * First name your measuring unit.  (As in "Stick", so you can say "the whiteboard is 21 sticks wide")  Choose a better aname than "stick".
   * Measure the height of someone in your group in sticks
   * You will need to construct auxiliary measuring devices to complete this task accurately. So you can subdivide for small objects, and so you can scale up for large ones)
   * Make a partitioned unit derived from your unit
   * Make a composed unit from your unit
   * Measure: your team whiteboard (length and width), the room itself (length, width, and height), and a paperclip (length and width).
   * Make a table with all of your measurements, expressed in original units, in partitioned units, and in composed units.  Put it into a google doc spreadsheet which I will share with you

 2. Fill out index card:
    Name
    Previous school
    Favorite subject
    Burning question
    Anything you want me to know about you

 3. About the class:  This is "Act Like a Scientist Class".  It's all about asking questions and figuring out how to go about answering them.  While it's nice to get the answers right, that is only a secondary concern here, and we really cherish mistakes because they help us grow more than anything else.

 4. So what are some of the lessons learned from the measurement game?
    different ways to do it
    can we convert between different ways?
    which way is "best"?
    how can we tell what is best?  What does it mean for a measurement to be "better"?
