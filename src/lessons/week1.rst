Day 1
=====

 1. New groups, setup winter week 1 notes and summaries.  Revisit expectations for good notes and good summaries.

 2. Drawing Input - Output diagrams.

  a. Draw a diagram showing the inputs and outputs to and from a bank account

  b. Draw a diagram showing the input and outputs to and from a taco truck

  c. Draw a diagram showing the inputs and outputs of cars on a city block 

 3. What can we learn from diagrams like these?  How do the input and output rates relate to changes of the quantity within the system?

Day 2
=====

 1. Measuring speed with the collision tracks.  Produce graphs showing the motion of the cars on the tracks as they move at constant velocity


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. Worksheet on interactions, velocity calculations, possibly using PhET simulations?
