:summary: Getting started with energy.  What is the difference between momentum and energy?
:category: lessons
:tags: energy, momentum, particle model



=====
Day 1
=====

 1. New groups, new summary template, new notes document.

 2. Demo -- salt with ice water

 3. Demo -- Magnesium + HCl

 4. Describe what happens.

 5. **What is interesting about it?**

 6. **Where does the energy go/ come from?**

 7. On-board demo: `Energy forms and changes <http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/energy-forms-and-changes>`_.  Describe all the ways to get energy into and out of the system in the simulation.  How do you increase the brightness of the lightbulbs?


=====
Day 2
=====

 1. **What is temperature?**

 2. Download the `Gas Properties simulation <http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/gas-properties>`_.  You may have to install java to be able to run it.  Please get it to run on at least one computer in your group.

 3. Play with the simulation with just one particle in the box.  Write down what you notice about the behavior of the particle when you turn gravity on or off, when you add heat or take away heat, or when you change the particle from the "Heavy Species" to the "Light Species".

 4. **What is temperature?**

 5. Run the `Energy Skate Park: Basics <http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/energy-skate-park-basics/latest/energy-skate-park-basics_en.html>`_ simulation in HTML5.

  a. If you drop the skater on the track in the Intro section, what happens to it?

  b. Turn on the pie charts and bar charts.  Write down what you notice about these charts.

  c. Pick up the skater and hold it at different points around the screen.  Write down what you notice about the pie chart and the bar chart.

  d. What do you have to do to get the skater moving as fast as possible?

  e. What are the different kinds of energy in the simulation, and what do they mean?

Day 3
=====

 1. Warm-Up:  Make a graph of the momentum vs. time for a collision between the cue ball and one other ball in a game of billiards (pool).  Assume that the cue ball doesn't spin at all.  Show the momentum of each ball from several seconds before the collision until several seconds after.

 2. What is your latest theory as to why the salt made the ice get colder?

 3. What happens to a chunk of ice sitting in a glass of water?  Imagine yourself as a single molecule in the ice -- draw a storyboard depicting what happens to you over time.

 4. What causes the ice to melt?

 5. What happens to the water as the ice melts?

 6. Why?

 7. Try out the `Reversible Reactions simulation <http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/reversible-reactions>`_.  

   a. Slowly add one particle at a time to the left side of the chamber (A type).  After each particle is added, write down what you notice about the behavior of the particles.

   b. Do they all travel the same speed?  Do any of them make it over the hill to the other side?  Why not?

   c. There are at least two ways to get some of the particles over to the other side -- what are they?  Why do they work?

   d. Explain in what way this is like the skateboarder in the Skate Park demo.

   e. What do you notice about the behavior of the particles once they make it to the right hand side?  Why does this happen?  Click the "Species Information" button for help on this one.

   f. Put one particle on the left side, then increase the temperature until the particle makes it over the hill.  Describe what happens when it is on the right and when it is on the left.

   g.  Open up the Skate Park demo again, and use the 3rd track in the Intro section.  What do you have to do so the movement of the skater is a good analogy for the movement of the particle in the other simulation?
