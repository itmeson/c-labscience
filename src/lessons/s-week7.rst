Day 1
=====

**A Block**: New groups, quiz, discussion of units for mass, distance, force, and energy.  We will be catching up to the other sections on Tuesday.


**QWarmup**: Play `Robot Moving Company <http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/forces-and-motion>`_ three times for each member of your group.  

Who has the highest score?
What determines how high your score is?  What do you have to do, physically, to get the maximum possible score?

**Q1**: How much energy does it take to push a 50 kg block with a force of 2 Newtons for 4 meters? Compute in Joules.

**Q2**: How fast will the block be moving when you let go?


The energy required to push something for a certain distance can be calculated
with the equation  $Energy = Force \\cdot Distance$.  This equation in part
explains the tradeoff we have observed in the use of levers and ramps.  A ramp
allows you to lift a heavy object using less force, but at the cost of pushing
it a greater distance.  A lever allows you to exert less force to lift an
object, but you have to move your hand on the lever *farther* than the object
actually moves.  This is because the ramp and the lever simply *transfer* the
energy from your hand to the object -- it still takes the same amount of energy
to lift the object, no matter how you do it, it's just that the machine can
allow you to get the same energy with less force.  The effort you exert (How
hard you have to push) is the force, but the energy you put into it is coming
ultimately from your food.

When we measure the speed something is moving, we are always figuring out in some
way how *far* the object moves and how much *time* it takes to do it.  The
speed of a car is measured in miles per hours, which means the ratio of how many
miles it travels divided by how many hours it takes.  (100 miles in 2 hours is a 
speed of 50 miles per hour).  So $Speed = \\frac{Distance}{Time}$.

Day 2
=====

**Q1**: How much energy does it take to push a *car* for 100 meters?

**Q2**: What factors determine how much force and how much energy it takes to move the car?

**Q3**: How much easier is it to push a car than it is to lift it?

**Q4**:  So how much energy does it take to push the car?

**Q5**:  Is that a lot of energy?  How many candy bars would that be?



=====
Day 3
=====

**Q1**: How much gasoline would it take to move the car from yesterday?

**Q2**: How much would that gasoline cost?

**Q3**: Why do we use gasoline instead of candy bars (or people) to move our cars?

**Q4**: Try some more sources of energy: electricity, AA batteries, coal, hydro, geothermal, charcoal, etc.

**Q5**: If cost is the only factor, make a ranking of energy sources from best to worst.
