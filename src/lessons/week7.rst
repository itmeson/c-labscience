=====
Day 1
=====

 1. New notes
 
 2. Why do mountain roads and trails always have switchbacks?

 3. Rube Goldberg guidelines and suggestions:

    a. Start from the final task and work backwards, one element at a time

    b. Running time does not matter -- a 5 second machine that works is better than a 5 minute machine

    c. Include all of the simple machines

    d. Use mechanical advantage in your simple machines.  If you place the fulcrum of a lever at the center, then the output force is always equal to the input force.  You get no advantage (though you do get a redirection of the force).  Set up your machine elements to multiply force or to decrease the length that you need to pull something.  Your writeup must include descriptions and calculations for each of these elements.

 4. Start bringing in supplies right away.

 5. Test each element in isolation, then work on making them talk to each other
