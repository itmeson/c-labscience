Each of you will be assigned one of these situations to research, to write detailed notes about in the notes document, and to explain to the rest of your group:

1) Many places in the world are currently dealing with water crisis. One location is Brazil, where deforestation is combining with weather patterns to cause a drought that is severeley `affecting the life of Brazil's residents <http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/11/22/455751848/as-brazils-largest-city-struggles-with-drought-residents-are-leaving>`_ .   `A recent discovery <http://blog.cifor.org/26559/the-science-is-clear-forest-loss-behind-brazils-drought?fnl=en>`_ suggests that deforestation is making the drought significantly worse. Forests in tropical areas supply water to "rivers" in the air that bring water to the interior part of the continent, which would otherwise be dry. When the forests are gone, that source of evaporation leaves, and drought is the result.

2) What about the drought in the American west and southwest? Lake Meade, one of the largest sources of fresh water for major Southwestern cities, is `recently forecast to <https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/2487>`_ dry up by 2012. More information about the drought in this area is found on this `site <http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/west/contents.asp>`_ explore and find a fact or two you can share. 

3) Given what we know about surface water and ground water, you can explain why farmers are thinking `this is a good approach <http://www.npr.org/2015/11/24/457277998/california-farmer-works-to-restore-groundwater-by-purposely-flooding-crops>`_, but by also increasing evaporation they may be making the problem worse. Ultimately, it's possible we are `completely underestimating <http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/humans-are-draining-even-more-earths-freshwater-we-thought-180957444/?no-is>`_ the water use in the world, because the lakes that give us fresh water also increase evaporation. This could spell disaster for the planetary water budget.
