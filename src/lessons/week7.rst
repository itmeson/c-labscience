Day 1
=====

 1. More of the roundest object.  What is the problem outlined in the video?  Why is it a problem?  What is the solution?

 2. How does the problem of "Le Grand K" outlined in the video relate to how we defined our units of length at the beginning of the year?

 3. Tomorrow we will start measuring speed -- thing about how you could possibly measure speed, and write a proposed method for measuring the speed of an object.

Day 2
=====

 1. A scientific notation example: 

 120700 meters.

 The format for scientific notation is $ \\mbox{Number} \\cdot 10^{\\mbox{Exponent}} $

 Determine how many significant digits are in the number, ex. 4, (1207)

 Put a decimal place after the first significant digit, ex. 1.207 (so the number will be between 1-10)

 Determine how many decimal places over the original number is from the new number, ex. 5

 This is the number of 10s, ex. $10^5$

 Put it all together to get your final answer, ex. $1.207 \\cdot 10^5$ meters.
 

 2. How do you measure speed?  We have these little battery operated cars that move at a pretty reliable constant speed.  You will use your proposed method from yesterday to measure the speed of the car several times, then we will compare the results with the rest of the class.

Day 3

 1. Do you have enough data to accurately and reliably determine the speed of the battery-operated car?  The answer is probably **no**, but to tell, we need to really look at the data.  Graphing the data points in a histogram can tell you something about how the data spreads out, giving you information about whether you are getting the same value every time you measure it (if you do, then you probably don't need very many trials).  If the data is all clustered around some common value, with a low standard deviation and a "normal" looking histogram, then you probably have enough data (though it often takes quite a number of trials before you can tell this).  And if the data seems to be all over the place, or changing in some systematic way (is the speed decreasing every time you measure it?  Then maybe the batteries are dying....), then you need more data to understand what is going on.

 2. How many significant digits should you report for the measured speed of the car?  The most important rule of thumb is that the calculated value cannot have any *more* digits than were present in the *least precise* measured value that went into the calculation.  To measure speed you need a distance and a time.  If the distance has 2 significant digits and the time has 4, your calculated speed should only have 2.

 3. Exit question:  How do you know the car was really moving at a *constant* speed?  Did any of you gather data that could tell you whether the car started slow and then sped up? Probably not, because all of you measured the speed by timing how long it took the car to travel one meter (or two meters in a few cases), but you didn't record any intermediate distances or times.  This means you were really measuring the *average speed* over the distance.  Next week we'll be repeating our measurements to figure out whether or not the speed changes while the car is moving.
