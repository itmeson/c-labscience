Ice with water
--------------

We saw yesterday that when you mix equal masses of warm water with cold water, the equilibrium temperature reached is equal to the midpoint of the two temperatures.  You also saw a couple of weeks ago that when the masses are different, the equilibrium temperature is equal to the *weighted* average of the temperatures, like this:

$$\\begin{equation}
T_{new} = \\frac{m_{cold}T_{cold} + m_{warm}T_{warm}}{m_{cold} + m_{warm}}
\\end{equation}
$$

The reason this works is that when two molecules collide, if one of the molecules loses energy, the other one picks up exactly the amount that was lost (energy is *conserved*).  So as the molecules of the warmer water collide with more and more of the molecules of the colder water, on average the warmer water *cools down* and the cooler water *warms up*.  The exact amount of kinetic energy that the cold water picks up is precisely equal to the amount of kinetic energy lost by the warmer water.  Thus the temperature has to "meet in the middle".  

But an equal mass of ice mixed with the water leads to a *lower* temperature than the weighted average.  This means that the process of melting the ice *takes more energy* out of the warm water than does the process of mixing the cold water in, *even if the cold water started just barely above 0C*.  

**How can that be?**  

Consider the reaction potential energy curves from yesterday_.  These are supposed to show the potential energy during a reaction, the left side of the plot showing the potential energy for the reactants (before the change) and the right side showing the potential enegy for the products (after the change).  The *ice gets warmer* during the mixing, and the *water gets colder*.  

**Does the potential energy of the water change when it loses or gains kinetic energy?**

**Does the potential energy of the ice change when it melts?**

**Does the potential energy of the water change when it freezes?**

In the ice-water mixture, there are three different ways we can break up the "system" -- there is the ice by itself.  There is the water by itself, and there is the whole ice-water system. 
 
**Does the total energy of the ice-water system change when you mix them together?**

**Does the total energy of the ice by itself change, when you mix it with the water?**

**Does the total energy of the water by itself change, when you mix it with the ice?**

Draw diagrams for each of the system components, showing the energy going in and out of each piece.  What form is this energy in? (potential, kinetic, total)  I am basically asking -- **How does the energy of each piece of the system change when you mix them together?**
