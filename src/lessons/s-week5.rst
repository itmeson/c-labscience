Day 1
=====


**QWarmup**:  Compare the forces on the two ends of the rope -- will A be bigger than B, B bigger than A, or will they be the same?  What is the tradeoff?

**BUILD**  This is the day to get things done, you should be close to wrapping up the whole thing and just working on fiddling with the setup to get it all perfect today and tomorrow.  We will be showcasing your devices on Day 3 and 4 this week.  As you get close, start filming your trial runs so you have some evidence of your progression (in case the showcase doesn't go so well). 

**EXPLAIN** Enlist another group, and walk them through the whole process of your machine.  They should ask you questions about how it works and about which parts were difficult.

**NOTES** From Week 3 are due tonight, they will be graded on Tuesday.  Mid-tri grades are cut-off on Thursday afternoon, so any makeups, retakes, etc. need to be done by then.


=====
Day 2
=====


**BUILD**  You should be *finished* today!  We will begin testing tomorrow and Friday, with minimum setup time available.  During the showcase the entire class will be watching your device and we will film every test run.  You get two attempts on your showcase to get it to run, and you will lose points each time you have to intervene during a run.

**DOCUMENT** Take pictures and video of your device to put in your notes and to showcase your work.  Be proud of your creation!


=====
Day 3
=====

**TESTING DAY**: 20 minutes setup time for the whole class, then each group will have a 10 minute slot in which to attempt two trial runs.  We will score both runs and take the highest score for your grade.


=====
Day 4
=====

**OVERFLOW Testing DAY**: 10 minutes setup time for remaining groups, then 10 minute slots to attempt two trial runs.
