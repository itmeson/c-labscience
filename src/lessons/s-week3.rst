Day 1 Levers
============

**QWarmup:  What are the advantages and disadvantages of a steep trail if you are climbing a mountain?**

I took a look at our initial data on levers from last week, and noticed a couple of funny things about the results, so today we're going to redo a few of those measurements, but first I want you to think carefully about what you should *expect* to see in a lever setup.

(A) The pivot is in the center of the lever, the mass is on one end (50cm away) and the pulling force is on the other end (also 50cm away).  


**Q1. How big is the downward force due to gravity on the mass?**

**Q2. How big should the pulling force be to hold the mass steady?**

(B) The pivot is still in the center of the lever, but the mass is only 20 cm away now, and the pulling force is also 20cm away.
 

**Q3. How big is the downward force due to gravity on the mass?**

**Q4. How big should the pulling force be to hold the mass steady?**


(C) Now the pivot is in the center of the lever, the mass is 20 cm away from the pivot, and the pulling force is 40cm away.

**Q5. How big is the downward force due to gravity on the mass?**

**Q6. How big should the pulling force be to hold the mass steady?**

Now do each of these measurements carefully, recording the results.  Something you should have noticed by now is that the downward force due to gravity acting on the mass doesn't change no matter what lever configuration you use.  You can find what that force is by attaching the mass directly to your spring scale and recording the reading it gives you -- that number is the force due to gravity in whatever units you are using.

(In the standard units, you would find the mass of the object in kilograms and measure the force in Newtons, and you would find that the force is approximately equal to $9.8$ time the mass.)

**Q7. Do your results match your predictions?  If so, do you trust them?  If not, can you suggest reasons why they might not match?  (Either the predictions are wrong or the measurements are wrong -- which is it and why?)**

=========================
Day 2 - Cuckoos vs. Crows
=========================

I heard the following story_ on NPR a few days ago and thought it would be interesting to discuss -- in the story they describe an interesting phenomenon that some scientists in Spain noticed, and two experiments they tried to help them understand the phenomenon. 


**Q1. Listen to the story, making sure you can identify what the phenomenon was, and how they set up the two experiments.**

**Q2. What was the hypothesis in each experiment?**

**Q3. Identify the independent and dependent variables in the two experiments.**

**Q4. Can you suggest ways that they might improve either of those experiments?**

**Q5. Are there other experiments they could do that would shed more light on the phenomenon?**


=============================================
Day 3 - More levers, introducing the projects
=============================================

What we've found so far this week is that as you move a force farther away from the pivot point, it's impact on the balance of the lever increases.  Conversely, if you move a force in toward the pivot, the impact goes down.  We also saw that if you move twice as far from the pivot, the required force is cut in half; if you move three times as far from the pivot, the required force goes down by a factor of one third.

Whenever you have this kind of tradeoff between two factors, where the one goes down in the same proportion that the other goes up, you have a multiplying effect -- somehow the *product* of $Force \\cdot Distance$ matters.  Think about how this makes sense: if Force times distance gives you the impact of a force on a lever, then doubling the force allows the distance to go down by half.  Doubling the distance allows the force to go down by half.

This can be summarized with the equation $F_1 \\cdot Distance_1 = F_2 \\cdot Distance_2$ whenever you have two forces acting somewhere on a lever.  Try to apply this to a few different cases:

(A) A lever where the pivot is in the center, with a mass of 200 grams, located 20 centimeters from the pivot.

**Q1. If the applied force is 10 centimeters from the pivot, how big must it be?**

**Q2. If the applied force is 30 centimeters from the pivot, how big must it be?**

**Q3. If the applied force is 40 centimeters from the pivot, how big must it be?**

You should be able to predict that the applied forces for the three cases will be $4 N$, $1.33N $ and $1 N$.  If you didn't get those, check in with Mark as soon as possible.


(B) Now consider a lever where the pivot is on one end, the mass is in the middle, and the pulling force is on the other end.  (The mass of 200 grams is located 15 centimeters from the pivot, and the appied force is located 35 centimeters from the pivot)

**Q4. How big is the downward force due to gravity on the mass?**

**Q5. What direction do you need to pull to keep the mass steady?**

**Q6. How big should the pulling force be to hold the mass steady?**

**What use would a lever like this be?  Can you give examples of this kind of lever?**

Now do each of these measurements carefully, recording the results and comparing to your predictions.  If your results differ significantly from your prediction, consider whether the prediction is wrong or the measurement is wrong.


(C) Now consider a lever where the pivot is on one end, the mass is on the other end, and the pulling force is somewhere in the middle. (The mass of 300 grams is located 50 centimeters from the pivot, and the applied force is located 20 centimeters from the pivot) 

**Q7. What direction do you need to pull to keep the mass steady?**

**Q8. How big should the pulling force be to hold the mass steady?**

**Q9. What use would a lever like this be?**

Now do each of these measurements carefully, recording the results and comparing to your predictions.  If your results differ significantly from your prediction, consider whether the prediction is wrong or the measurement is wrong.


Project Introduction
--------------------

The most important thing about these simple machines we've been looking at (the ramp and the lever) is that they always involve a tradeoff.  A ramp allows you to lift something using less force, at the cost of having to move it a greater distance.  A lever allows you to lift something with either more or less force, at the cost of moving it less distance or more distance, and of having a longer or shorter lever.  All machines involve a similar tradeoff of one quantity for another.

We're now going to look at some other examples of such machines, and begin to think about a long-term project that we will be working on when we come back from spring break.

First let's look at this video, which was originally a long (almost 10 minutes!) *commercial* for Chevrolet.

    .. youtube:: yYAw79386WI
        :align: center


**Q10. What is the tradeoff when you have objects travelling along circular paths?**

**Q11. What was the problem that needed to be solved to make cars turn smoothly?**

**Q12. How was this problem solved?**

The gears described in the video also represent another use for machines -- to translate force in one direction into force in another direction.  The drive shaft of a car is connected to the engine, and it rotates in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction the car needs to travel.  So the first task of the differential gear in the video was to translate that force to make the wheels spin in the direction we want the car to move.  The second task was to allow the two wheels to spin at different speeds, so the car could turn smoothly without the tires slipping.

Now take a look at the following video of a Rube Goldberg device that turns the pages of a newspaper.

    .. youtube:: GOMIBdM6N7Q
	:align: center


The interesting thing in this video is how it shows just a few simple elements / machines, repeated over and over again with subtle changes in execution.  How many different times did you see something dropping, with the energy of the falling object captured in causing some other object to move sideways?  That represents a transfer of energy and a repeated use of the potential energy of an object by making it fall.  

**Q13. What other elements did you see, repeated over and over?**

Take a look at this other Rube Goldberg, from a music video by OK Go:

    .. youtube:: qybUFnY7Y8w
	:align: center

**Q14. Identify as many repeated elements as you can.**

Our mid-term project is going to be to construct similar devices in your current groups.  Search for other such videos, record the link in your notes, and write down all the transitional elements you can.  Start thinking about how you would build a similar device.
