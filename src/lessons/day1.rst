Today's Topics
==============

 1. How much water is this? (Break into groups of 2 or 3, take water sample, and come up with at least two ways to measure how much is there.  Prepare a whiteboardthat explains your method, and be prepared to present to the class.)
 2. Do sign-in on smartboard
 3. Fill out index card:
    Name
    Previous school
    Favorite subject
    Burning question
    Anything you want me to know about you
 4. About the class:  This is "Act Like a Scientist Class".  It's all about asking questions and figuring out how to go about answering them.  While it's nice to get the answers right, that is only a secondary concern here, and we really cherish mistakes because they help us grow more than anything else.
 5. So what are some of the lessons learned from measuring the water?
    different ways to do it
    can we convert between different ways?
    which way is "best"?
    how can we tell what is best?  What does it mean for a measurement to be "better"?

New Homework
============

1. Create twitter account or sign-in to the class account, and post one _question_ using the #SAASlabsci hashtag.  Visual aids are fine, but not necessary.  You are welcome to follow my personal account, but I won't follow you back.  Make sure to never mix up your personal tweeting with class stuff.  Send an email to mbetnel@seattleacademy.org with your full name and the twitter handle you will be using for the class.  If you use the class account, makeup a username that you will post in every tweet.

2.  Look back through the other posts (both mine and other students') and respond to at least one of them (use the reply function).  I most want to see follow-up questions, but answers or guesses or thoughts about how to answer them are also good.
