Day 1
=====

Work day for the project report.

Here's the details of what needs to be in the report:

1. A written description of your device, including a clear explanation of what
the ending task was and a step by step timeline of each element (written as a
paragraph)

2. Your design drawings, both one large drawing showing the entire device and
drawings of each individual element as you intended it to work.  You cannot get
credit for an element towards the required 10 unless there is a separate
drawing for it.

3. A classification of each element in the device.  Kind of energy: electrical,
mechanical, chemical, thermal, light; and kind of machine: lever, pulley, gear,
wheel and axle, ramp, screw, etc.  This can be a bullet list, but you should
explain/justify why you believe this element qualifies.  You should also
explain how you built this element, the testing you had to go through, and any
difficulties you had in building, testing, and running, etc.  Again, you cannot
get credit for an element unless it is listed here with the explanation and
justification.

4. Narrative analysis, at least answering the debriefing questions we discussed on Friday:

  a. What went right?

  b. What went wrong? Which parts just wouldn't work?

  c. What were you missing that you needed? (materials, resources, concepts)

  d. Suppose you were given an opportunity to do this project again fromvscratch.  What would you do the same?  What would you do differently? (you should think of specific things like: No more dominoes, or Fire worked great, as well as more general things like: design timeline and testing method.


5. Your self-reflection on how well you contributed to the team, and your
feedback to your teammates on how well they contributed to the team  -- we will
discuss this aspect on Tuesday/Wednesday.


The report should be written as a group in a Google Doc.  Attach all relevant
photos, drawings, videos, etc. within the document (so if your designs are on
paper, take good photos of them to put in the doc).

Day 2
=====

**QWarmup**: Measure the force to lift an object straight up and the force to lift it with a lever.  Figure out how high the object gets in each case, and find the product of the  Force times the distance the object moves.

Force times distance is energy.  You have the tradeoff because you can't change how much energy is required.

**Review**:
 1. Mass is measured in ?

 2. Force is measured in ?  How do you find the force required to lift against gravity?

 3. Distance is measured in ?

 4. Energy is measured in ....?


Compare, would you rather have the amount of energy required to:

Heat a pot of water?
Live for a day?
Light a bulb?
Walk up stairs?
Lift a weight?
Read a book?
Move your car?



=====
Day 3
=====

**Self and peer reflection**: Consider the following questions as you reflect on your own contribution to your group:


1.  Did I do a fair share of the work of the project?
2.  Was the quality of my work high?
3.  Did I support/encourage my teammates?  Did I take action that affected my team without consulting them?
4.  Did I notice what my teammates were doing and whether they were on track?
5.  Did I demand high quality work?
6.  Did I have the knowledge or skills to contribue successfully?  Did I acquire knowledge or skills to contribute successfully?

Submit your feedback through the `form <https://docs.google.com/a/seattleacademy.org/forms/d/1Eh7F0n84HLycMQwG-FdVCEObvHELhW2CukJVdk1K3Po/viewform?usp=send_form>`_. -- you must submit once for each member of your group.
