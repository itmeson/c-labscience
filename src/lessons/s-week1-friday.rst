Spring Quiz 1

Where we Stand

So what does the salt do?
-------------------------

We know that the salt increases the boiling point and also lowers the freezing
point.  This is the only way to explain what we saw when we added salt to the
ice or to the hot water.  Somehow the salt makes it harder for water molecules
to escape the liquid surface when you heat it up -- the fact that the
temperature is higher when it boils means that the water molecules need more
energy to escape when there is salt than they do when there is no salt.

Conversely, the salt makes it *easier* for the water molecules to escape from
the ice, because the lower freezing point means that they need less energy to
get away from the ice surface when there is salt than they do when there is no
salt.

We also know that salt dissolved in water will cause the temperature of the
water to decrease, in the same way that ammonium chloride (instant ice-packs)
causes the temperature to decrease when dissolved in water.

**What does this fact about the temperature when you dissolve salt in water
tell you about the potential energy curve for salt dissolving in water?**


But the fact that salt lowers the temperature of water, by itself does not
explain why salt lowers the freezing point or increases the boiling point (and
it contradicts the fact that the *time* it takes to boil decreases with the
salt). 

Let's think about this in terms of the potential energy curves.

**Draw (again) the potential energy curve for the transition from ice to liquid
water**

**Now think about the fact that salt makes the freezing point decrease, which
means that the liquid water produced when the ice melts will be *colder* than
0C -- how must the potential energy curve change when you add the salt?**

**Now draw (again) the potential energy curve for the transition from liquid
water to steam (boiling)**

**Think about the fact that the salt makes the boiling point increase, which
means that the steam produced when the water boils will be *hotter* than 100C
-- how must the potential energy curve change when you add the salt?**
