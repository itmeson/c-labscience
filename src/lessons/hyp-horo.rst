The key is to make it sound specific, while actually being vague. When reading a horoscope, people tend to say "That sure does sound like me," or "That did happen to me," because they are trying to make it fit into their life. How else would one horoscope work for 1/12 of the planet?



Writing Your Own Horoscopes
---------------------------
1.  Try very general statements like "A very interesting financial transaction is headed your way." This is better than "Money is headed your way," because some people may not get money but rather lose money or spend money. It makes more people believe you're talking at them.Use the word "financial" because it is not money-specific, but could refer to trading of goods. Include the word interesting because "A financial transaction is headed your way," is too vague and unbelievable as a horoscope. People have financial transactions of some form every day, but when they read "an interesting financial transaction," they will try to isolate one of their transactions as being "interesting." Most people who read horoscopes try to rationalize them on a subconscious level.
2.  Things that cannot be confirmed work well. Try something like "A potential romantic interest will talk to you," or "Today you will interact with someone who likes you." They will go through their day and encounter many people. Rather than interview each person they interacted with to find out if any of them secretly have a crush on them, they will quietly think about it on their own, asking themselves which one it was that liked them. Don't say "A romantic interest will reveal themselves to you," because that leads to the expectation of something solid, while something vague makes them wonder if that passing smile they got while walking down the street was perhaps something more.
3.  Make horoscopes that rely on the readers' personal efforts to be confirmed. Use statements like "An amazing opportunity will arise, if you are willing to take it," or "Stay alert, you will get some important information today." This way, if it seems like nothing that day was important, the rationale is that they must not have been paying enough attention, or that they did in fact learn something important, but they were unable to discern its importance, or that its importance will become apparent in the future.
4.  Consider length. One-liners are good and simple. These basic ideas can be stretched out to be a short paragraph in length, but don't overdo it.
5. Consider your audience. If you're aiming at ''The Wall Street Journal'', try something like "Your co-worker will make your day." If you're aiming at a tabloid, try something like "The alignment of the stars suggests that someone you know will make your day." Not all target audiences will appreciate the "stars in alignment" angle. Of course, if you can read the stars, by all means do so. Simply put, think about who is reading it before you write it.
6.  Just speak your mind whatever you are feeling tell others that they are feeling the same, that way you are doing good in the world by making everyone equal. If you are mad influence others to be the same as you, If you are happy then let that upon others,ect.


Tips
----
Try not to be too specific. Think of the difference between "You will see a friend," and "You will see a friend in the parking lot."
Tag an unsure onto a sure. By tagging the idea of "You will learn something," (which is almost guaranteed) to the prediction "It will be important," you add validity. If your prediction is guaranteed to be at least half true, it's a shorter distance for the mind to travel to full belief.
Try to avoid the "You are a nice person" types of statements - fortune cookies have that area covered.
Don't be too nonspecific. Think of the difference between "You will see a friend," and "You will see someone."

Warnings
--------
Beware of the powerful nature of horoscopes and their influence on readers. As the predictions may subconsciously register causing for them to become a potential future rather than predicting it (i.e. a self-fulfilling prophecy).


Examples
--------
1. A chance encounter this week will change your perspective.
2. If you are vigilant, you will find something you have been missing for a while.
