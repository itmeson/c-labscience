Intro 
=====

We know several things by now about heat, temperature, reactions, energy and molecular motion:  

1. Hotter things have faster moving molecules.

2. If something moves uphill (increases in potential energy) its speed decreases (so therefore it's kinetic energy decreases, and, if we are talking about molecules, it's *temperature* decreases too.  

3. Chemical reactions involve the breaking and/or formation of chemical bonds.

4. Some chemical reactions cause the surroundings to get colder, some cause them to get warmer.

5. There is a potential energy curve for chemical reactions, which is in some ways like the curve of a skate park.  If the potential energy is lower after the reaction is over, then, just like a skater going downhill, the kinetic energy of the molecules (and so their temperature) will increase.  If the potential energy is higher after the reaction is over, then, just like a skater going uphill, the kinetic energy of the molecules (and so their temperature) will decrease.

What do you have to do to make a substance get hotter?  Heat it with something that is warmer than it -- but what happens when you do that?  If the hotter thing (like a hot plate) is hotter, than that must mean that it's molecules are moving faster.  If those faster moving things collide with slower moving things, what happens, in general?  The slower ones will speed up, the faster ones slow down, and they sort of meet somewhere in the middle in temperature, kinetic energy, and speed.

Thus if you mix two equal mass samples of water at different temperatures, then the temperature of the combined mixture will be in the middle between the two, 50g $H_2O$ at $20C$ mixed with 50g $H_2O$ at $50C$ will end up at $35C$, since 35 is the average of 20 and 50

If you mix samples of different masses, then the average is weighted by the mass of the samples.  50g $H_2O$ at 20C with 100g $H_2O$ at 50C will end up hotter than the first example, because there is more of the hotter water in the mix.  You can think of it like there are 50 pieces of $20C$ water, and 100 pieces of $50C$ water, and 150 pieces in all, so the average will be:  $\\frac{50\\cdot20 + 100\\cdot50}{150} = \\frac{1000 + 5000}{150} = \\frac{6000}{150} = 40$ -- 40C.
  
Some of the energy of the warmer material is transferred to the colder one in the form of  making the molecules move faster, until the energy is evenly shared, at which point there is a temperature equilibrium.


But the averaging is a little more complicated if a phase change is involved -- turning a solid to a liquid or a liquid to a solid (as in the ice-water / water-ice transition) involves, in addition to transferring energy to make the molecules move faster, also transferring energy to break or form the bonds that hold water molecules together when they form ice.  In the transition from gas to liquid or liquid to gas (as when you boil water to make steam, or you cool steam to condense the water) there is similarly energy being transferred to break or form bonds that give liquid water it's "liquidy" properties.

**A** What this means in practice is that, while you should expect a mixture of 50 grams of water at 1C with 50 grams of water at 50C to have a mixing temperature of 25.5C (simple average), mixing 50 grams of *ice* at 0C with 50 grams of water at 50C will end up at a significantly lower temperature than 25C, because it takes more of the energy of the warmer water *just to melt the ice* than it does to warm the newly formed water up.



**A** An interesting effect occurs if you compare the mixed temperature of very cold water with warmer water versus the mixed temperature of an equal mass of *ice* with the warmer water.

**B** Another interesting effect occurs if you mix salt in with the water before you put it in contact with the ice.

**C** And yet another interesting effect occurs if you mix salt in with water before you boil it.



Your final project for the winter trimester will be to fully investigate one of these three phenomena.  


What does a "full investigation" look like?  Purpose, Prediction, Procedure, Data, Analysis, and Conclusion are all the parts of the lab report and presentation, so your experimental work and documentation should be geared to allow you to produce all of those, while answering a central question about one of the three scenarios.  You should decide what your central and auxiliary questions are, decide what your independent and dependent variables are, then collect data to support these questions (ie, systematically vary the independent variable while measuring the response on the dependent variables).

You should produce graphs from this data to tell the story of what happened, and to answer your questions.

And your analysis *must* include a discussion of sources of uncertainty in your *measurements* and in your *conclusions*.


====================
Doing the Experiment
====================

Since at the start, you do not yet know precisely what the phenomenon is, nor how big an effect it will be, you are not in a good position to design a full experimental process -- you might end up with too much water, too much or too little salt, not frequent enough (or too frequent) temperature measurements.  The best thing to do then is just try it out -- combine water with ice and measure the final temperature, then add some salt into the water first, and try again.  This will give you a better sense of what we are talking about, how big the effect will be, and how to design your experiment.

Once you have done this, construct a central question which your experiment will try to answer.  For example, when we investigated
