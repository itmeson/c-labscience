Over the summer my younger brother had a birthday, and our mom made a birthday cake with a LOT of candles on it.  Some of those  candles were relighting candles -- he would blow them out only to have them spring back up a few seconds later.


After a minute or two of trying, he got them all out, and he believes that he has discovered a system that allows him to blow out the relighting candles every time.
