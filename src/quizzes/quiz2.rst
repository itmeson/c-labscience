   :alt: Correct potential energy curve for phase changes of water


1.  **R1** What does this graph say that is *different* from what we thought about bond potential energy a week ago? (You need to say what we used to think, and what this graph says that is different)
 
2.  **C1** Explain how this graph does fit with what we know about phase changes in water.
 
3.  **M2** If you use a ramp to lift a heavy object, the job becomes easier in one respect and harder in another -- explain what the tradeoff is.
