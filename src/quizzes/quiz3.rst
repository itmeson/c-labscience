1.  **M1** If you put 300 grams on one end of a lever, 30 centimeters from the pivot point, how hard do you need to pull on the other end to make the lever balance, if the other end is 50 centimeters from the pivot?
 
2.  **R4** What was the hypothesis that the first experiment was designed to test in the Cuckoo vs. Crows story? (You can listen to the story again if necessary, but use headphones: http://www.npr.org/2014/03/20/291977035/this-freeloading-bird-brings-help-and-the-help-smells-gross )
 
3.  **R3** What did their data show about that hypothesis? Was it right or wrong? How did the data prove it?
 
4.  If the result had come out the other way, what would they have seen in the data for the first experiment?
