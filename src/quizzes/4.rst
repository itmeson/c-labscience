 A gasoline pump can pump gasoline at a rate of 6.5 gallons per minute.  You have a European car whose gas tank is labeled in Liters.  How long (in seconds) will it take to pump enough gas to fill the 51 Liter tank? (assuming it was empty to begin with)  How much will the gas cost if the price is $3.60 per gallon?


Possibly useful information:

1.27 US dollars = 1 Euro        

1 gallon = 4 quarts        

2 pints = 1 quart

2 cups = 1 pint            	

1 cup = 236.59 milliliters    

60 seconds = 1 minute

1000 milliliters = 1 Liter        

1 quart = .946 Liters
