1.  Suppose you mix 30 grams of water at 20 Celsius with 70 grams of water at 10 Celsius and with 60 grams of water at 35 Celsius (so there are THREE beakers being combined). What will be the lowest temperature reached on mixing?
 
2.  Compare the result of mixing 50 grams of water at 30 C with 50 grams of water at 0C (very cold water, but not ice) with the result of mixing 50 grams of water at 30C with 50 grams of ICE at 0C. You answer should say which of the two is higher or if they are the same, and should also explain why the result is surprising.
 
3.  Give an explanation for the surprising result in (2). Your explanation does not have to be correct, but it does have to *fit*, meaning that if your idea was correct, then it really would cause the effect described in (2).
 
4.  Compare the result of boiling pure water to the result of boiling water that has a significant amount of salt dissolved in it. Your answer should explain both *what* is different and *why* it is surprising.
 
5.  Describe what happens when you mix a large amount of salt with ice. Your answer should explain both *what* happens and *why* it is surprising.
 
6.  Explain how the result in (5) relates to the fact that they put salt on the roads when it is icy or snowy.
